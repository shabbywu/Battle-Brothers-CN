You crawl forward to get a better look only to have a branch snap under your weight. The little men stop instantly and look toward you like a herd of prey. One yells in gibberish and the lot of them skip and hop away, diving into tree holes or into bushes. When you go down to see them out, you find nothing. They've vanished entirely.

Lifting the page, you find the alp's death mask there, maw open in grisly black permanence. You stare at the mask, you can hear something within it, something clattering its teeth like thrown dice, and the sides of it seem to be vibrating, giving its flesh a bubbling look. With a shrug and laugh you throw it on top of the map as a paperweight. Damn thing is gonna get lost if the men keep moving it around like this.}"
