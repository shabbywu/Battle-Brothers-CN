But then you notice that none of them have their weapons out nor do they carry the faces of men about to commit a murder. While they don't seem to be forming a mutiny to take your head, you keep the thought in mind nonetheless.\n\n You are only further relieved when they don't immediately start talking, instead waiting for your words to come first. This is a show of respect, and so the thought of reaching for your sword grows more distant. Crossing your arms over the table, you ask them what is on their minds.\n\n They explain that the company is too thin. Everywhere they go there is danger and the men are now concerned that every new battle shall be their last. Finally, they state their wants outright: if they are going to survive, they're going to need more brothers by their side."

You see the man's eyes flare open as he sees a calamity he can't stop from coming. The flail crashes through his maelstrom of metal and clips him in the face. Knocked out cold, he spins on his feet and collapses to the ground. A falling dagger penetrates his leg and the axe cuts tumbles right into his hip.

He says that some gods might find this battle favorable, but that most would not. Most of all, though, the monk says that if they truly wish to fight, then there is plenty of room for that after they die. However, if they kill one another, the loser is given great prestige in the afterlife, and the winner will not, for this violence serves no purpose than to give the victor pride. Surprisingly, this oddity in religious rules calms the men down. The monk invites them to talk more and they do so, the three walking off, hands gesticulating, backs arching in bellowing laughter.

Most of the fruit is soft to the touch, covered in what appears to be grey fur. All that's left otherwise has been thrown into a great stew which the men have aptly named 'crotch broth'. To be frank, it isn't looking good.\n\nHowever, by some fortuitous coincidence, a small farm stands in the distance.

A worker baling hay plants his pitchfork in the ground and tents his hands over it. They all watch you with nervous curiosity as you cross the plains, your men not at all trying to hide their want of the passing crops.\n\nWhen you near the homestead, a woman comes out to meet you. She wipes her brow and asks what it is that you want. A few children come out of a nearby home and stand on the porch. They eye you tentatively behind the legs of an older man, possibly the woman's father."

The rest of your company fans out, unsheathing their swords as they run into the fields. A few farmhands try to fight back, but your well-armed band makes short work of them. %someguy2% sprints into the homestead and inside you hear a number of cries that, one by one, disappear until there is silence. You hand the woman off to a few brothers, telling them to just make sure she is dead before you leave.

He sniffs gingerly like a blind mole come across a bizarre impasse. Just as you begin to ask if the man is alright, he throws the cloak back, revealing himself. That which faces you is a tired figure. Hobbled. Sleepless days pinch creases about his eyes. Reddened cheeks spread as he smiles.

Footprints in the earth suggest something big had come through, leaving behind a wake of ruin and calamity, and no urge on your part to follow where those steps go. | Marching along, you find a dead man with a few broken arrows in his back.

Let me tell ya, this ain't my first time going down a well. Five years ago I'd done it while repairing the wellhead, because the wellhead breaks often, you see. And it's not really a wellhead, we just call it that cause we're lazy. Back in my day we called it a... well, heh well, I actually done forgot. I guess a 'wellhead' makes sense now, as I'm not well in the head! Ho! Still got it. I was quite the charmer in my days, you see, and it's not often I get to put the practice in. M'wife died ten years ago, and the one prior to her left me twenty winters ago! I say winters, because that's when she left me, in the winter. It was a brutal one and I had asked her to help chop the wood lest we all freeze. She said she wasn't doing that shit and taking care of the kids at the same time. I had kids with her as well as with the second wife. Five total. One died. Measles. Another disappeared, so he's probably dead. I try to be honest to myself about it, but you know, there's hope. If a random stranger can be found in the forest to save me in the nick of time, then maybe my son survived that battle with the greenskins. Ain't heard of him, though. I pray to the old gods and even that Davkul fella every now and again. Do you know of Davkul? I'm not sure what to make of it. One time this man came by with a scar on his forehead, said he'd show me the way of darkness. I said I see darkness everytime I nap. This scarred fella said one day I won't wake and I said good! Ha!

It is a beautiful sight, but also an exhausting one. Hiking through the passes - and sometimes finding passes of your own - has been hard on the men. Slopes of whinstone and sediment and unruly gravel have your men clambering on hands and knees. Each slippery talus funnels the weary back down from whence they came, testing the resolve of those who are not keen on so many a repeat journey.\n\n And yet, around you there are mountain goats traipsing about. One bounds impossibly up an anticline with mocking ease and another chamfers on dry grass between confused bleats. Bridges of stone, cantilevered overhead with jurassic geology, bear the winking heads of curious mountain lions. You get the feeling they've seen your kind before. They know not to attack, but they follow nonetheless. Maybe one of you will fall and break something and the maimed shall be left behind because carrying the wounded in such a place is a death for two.\n\nTaking stock of your men, you find many are suffering injuries. Shin splints. Sore calves. Throbbing knees. Probably some broken bones, but nothing fatal. Only the strong and agile can safely navigate their way through a place such as this, and indeed they are typically the first to the top of every climb."

It is younger than the hands that own it, a replacement of a replacement of a replacement. He shows no fondness for it, but when he touches it you sense there is a reflection in the very idea of a sword, of how a man lengthens himself with it, and how he shortens others by its very blade.

msgid "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img] {A wagon, tipped over. Dead horses by its side. One dead donkey with evidence of having put up a fight. Women. Children. A couple of older men. Most mutilated in a fashion unsuitable for being found by anyone, but you figure your company was probably the best fit to come across such ruin. You've got the stomach for it, for you have created worse. It is the innocence of the dead that turns the gut, though, and in a feeble effort to rectify that moral illness you go ahead and bury the dead. Sadly, nothing of value is found in their remains. | Blood in the ditch by the side of the road. Blood all across the road. Blood in the ditch on the other side of the road. Blood up on the canvas of the wagon. Blood in the dead's eyes and blood in their mouth. One poor farmer, deceased, seemingly happened upon by a band of thieves for nothing of value he carried remains in the ruin you've stumbled upon. | The birds were the first hint: cycling and turning over a distant calamity. You figured whatever they saw was still alive, but by the time you got to it the flock had landed and you stumbled across a dead man leaning up against a sidepost.\n\nYou try and scare the birds away. The black buzzards only hop a few steps in the opposite direction where they then turn to stare at you. The corpse is fresh, the means to its death a slow one: a few arrows stick out of his side. A rope on his hip suggests he had a purse there. Someone robbed him - twice. | You stumble across a few hanged criminals. They swing from a tree by the side of the road, their faces mere impressions beneath the woolsacks over their heads. A few of them show signs of torture: gashes here and there, the glaring muscles turning purple and some already grey. Blood beneath one's feet, suggesting someone had a go at him while he suffocated. Naturally, they have nothing of value so you get back on the road. | A goat with a bell cradled in the arms of a dead shepherd. You found the pair by the side of the road. The animal's throat is open, and the man's body has no wounds. Maybe he died of a broken heart. %randombrother% rifles through the dead man's pockets and comes up empty handed. You decide to leave the two where they were. | Two buzzards clasp a string of intestine between the two of them, slowly chomping it down until their beaks clack together. You'd be humored if it weren't for where this meal had come from: a dead child, he or she lying face down on the ground. The back had been torn away, a lurid ribcage glistening in the sun.\n\nYou scare off the birds - though they are quite reluctant to be scared at all - and then bury the body. Moving back onto the road, you see the two birds squatting over the grave, picking and prodding at the dirt {in some sort of avian angst | as if to somehow recreate the process they'd seen but in reverse}. Giving up, they eventually take flight, circling above your band of men for a mile or two before heading elsewhere. | The fires crackle and pop as they consume the last of the wagon. %randombrother% picks through the blackened mess, but comes up empty handed. A few hands can be found sticking up out of the ash and soot, their forms as equally black. The bodies are completely gone, buried or burned away or buried beneath that which was burned away. Seeing as how there is nothing to salvage, you quickly get the company back on the road. | A dead horse. Its rider is across the road, having crawled to his final resting spot. Broken arrows litter the path, the heads of them ripped off and salvaged. The man is missing his scalp, the cap of his head glinting and red. After a quick search you realize there's nothing here to take and decide to move on. | You come across a pile of naked bodies by the side of the road. Some of them look ghastly, as though they've been dead for a great long while, though rather fresh blood is in some of their mouths. A few of the corpses carry color in their flesh, but they have what look like bite marks here and there. Preemptive measures were taken, it seems, for every one of them has had his or her neck slashed. Naked as they are, you naturally find nothing but what is natural to nature itself. You move on. | You feel as though you are being stared at and stop, quickly turning to the side of the road with a hand on your sword. A head stares back at you with its eyes barely peeping over some grass. %randombrother% walks over and picks it up. The face carries the visage of a rather jarring death, being so slackjawed and slanted. You tell the sellsword to put the head down for you've better things to do.}"

The roots go through the earth and into the realm of the gods.
