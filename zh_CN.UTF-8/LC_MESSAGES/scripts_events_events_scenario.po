"如果你在各地旅行，你应该在乡村和城市雇佣新人来填补你的队伍。 许多宣誓效忠的人之前从未拿起过武器。 也许他们是感到绝望了，也许是他们只是想贪婪地想要得到战斗过后的战利品。 他们绝大部分的人将会死在战场上。 但是不要气馁。 这就是雇佣兵的生活，当你来到下一个村子的时候总是会有新的人热切的想要开始一段新的生活。\n"

"现在这片土地很危险。 强盗和抢劫者埋伏在路边，野兽在黑暗的森林中游荡，兽人部落在文明的边界之外躁动不安。 甚至有传言说因为黑魔法的作用，死人从坟墓里爬起来再次行走在人间。 无论你是在土地上的各个村庄和城市中签订合同，还是通过自己的探险或者掠夺，都有机会赚大钱。\n"

All you knew is you never got to hold Young Anselm's skull, and last you saw some Oathbringer had stolen off with the lad's preeminent jaw. Leaving the Oathtakers was the best decision you ever made, if only to preserve what little sanity you had left.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, the faithful have a strong nose for the apostate's scent. When you opened the door this morning it was like looking at two piles of shite some prankster kid had left you: %oathtaker1% and %oathtaker2%, in the flesh. The former an older man who simply never shook his beliefs, and the latter a talented squire who reminds you of yourself. No doubt the more mawkish talker, it was the younger lad who made his plea: the Oathtakers need a man familiar with the land to help them around, completing quests and oaths. You shut the door only to find the older man's foot in it. He held up a pile of gold, and your nose must have wrinkled or wiggled because both men lit up.\n"
"\n"
"Now, you're only going along because times are tough, and because mercenary work – even under the guise of religious duty – can make some outstanding coin. And if someone is willing to bankroll you into such an opulent task, then so be it. There is only one condition: you will take the Oath of Captaincy, which means all the battling and rough roading will be done by others. Without pause, the Oathtakers agree, and then they show you Young Anselm's skull. You've lost touch with the organization, but seeing that lad's dumb dome still brings a stir in your heart. %oathtaker2% nods.%SPEECH_ON%Let us scour these lands for the honorable, and be diligent in our tasks, and may we ever make Young Anselm whole again from the rat bastard Oathbringers who broke him!%SPEECH_OFF%}"

In a single line they walked out to the town square where they had been holding a festival. Jewels and treasures filled their arms and they dumped the goods where you stood, boot atop the smashed skull of their mayor. Your vanguard of %raider1%, %raider2%, %raider3% and %raider4% kept careful watch of the ceremony like buzzards watching a slow death.\n"

" The last in the line was a monk. He had no gold or silver on him, but instead spoke to you, his words immediately drawing the weapons of your fellow raiders. You allowed him to speak, and he spoke at length about the old gods and how the treasures of the heavens superseded all of that which terra could offer. You told him his death was written by that wagging chin of his. The monk pursed his lips.%SPEECH_ON%Alright, then if you want gold, depart these silly games. This raiding and pillaging, it is all worthless compared to the treasures of the south. The nobles won't have you in their armies, but they are forever in need of mercenaries and rarely have the time or luxury of choosing where these hired fighters come from. You'd make all the crowns you'd ever want. Come south, raiders, and be sublimated into sellswords.%SPEECH_OFF%%raider3% demands the monk's head, but you stay the execution. Instead, you take the crafty monk at his word. You've long heard of southern riches and the travels of adventurous swords for hire. You decide to venture south - so long as the monk comes with. %raider3% protests, but you won't have it. If this pale little shit of a monk is your lucky charm to a new life, then it would be an affront to the old gods to leave him be. The raider storms off, but %raider1%, %raider2% and %raider4% have no qualms about following you. The rest of the war party returns north, a split in the loot being made. What remains of the village is left behind to recover, rebuild, and make new goods for stronger tribes to come and take for themselves.}"

"[img]gfx/ui/events/event_147.png[/img]{It should be a simple matter, killing a man, but unfamiliarity toughens the flesh: murderers caught in the street, choking away, arms tensed, hands clenched, screaming why won't their victims die. The motherly estate come undone, hitting her husband with the fire iron, again and again, and yet he still draws breath long after the flames have died. A bored Vizier unsure of why his torturers struggle with a criminal, the maddened man mocking them as they cut away appendages most important.\n"
"\n"
"But to a gladiator a man is not just a man, he is a wielder of weapons. Swords, axes, spears, tridents, and more. Once you are past all these manifested defenses, he is mere flesh most familiar, and to dispatch him is not a matter of struggle, but of entertainment. Entertainment! Competition with every ounce of skin in the game, and the revelry of the crowds. These are the things you love. Let the philosophers wax on and off about the nature of how things come to live and die. When you plunge a sword into some fool's neck, not only does blood gush upon your blade, but the crowd gushes upon your accomplishment! It is the most wonderful sound in the world! And the women who come after, so hot and bothered they don't even wait for you to clean the entrails off before jumping your bones? Glorious.\n"
"\n"
"But it gets boring, too. How many fights has it been? You can't count. How many challenges? You can't even name a single one. Not a single one! %g1%, %g2%, and %g3% all agree: you're just too good. And they're pretty good, too, if you're being honest. All four of you agree, though: you shall depart the arenas and forge a champion's spirit across the whole world.\n"
"\n"
"The gladiators have some proclivities for the opulent, particularly for scented baths and jewelry that spells their names, so be prepared to pay a tidy sum for each as you finance their lavish lifestyles outside the comfort of the city states. And so it will be. Your three solid, but not all-time great fighting buddies will display their martial prowess, and you will be matched with a new challenge: learning how to manage warriors (who are not at your level) and their needs.}"
