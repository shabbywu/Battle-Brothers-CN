Marching your company inward, the webbing begins to take a sort of civilized shape, as though you were walking in from wintery hinterland, the recency of its creation apparent in its tight trappings: deer, dogs, man-sized cocoons which show no sign of life, all bound snug in the hangars of white silos and planes like morsels lost upon a pale rug. A black shadow saunters up behind the veiled domicile, coming to the fore with its legs squatting defilade, its head crouched beyond them as though the foul cretin were gated by its own stride. A human hand sucks in and out from its mandibles like some macabre pacifier. You've come to the right place. | The webknecht nest is silent and the clatter of the company's arrival seems apocryphal, with the chink and clink of metals distinctly sharp in their trespass.\n"

He asks you cut his eyelids free of the webbing which you oblige. His lids slowly close, the crust of the dry eyes crackling closed for the first time in possibly days. But then they snap open and the man screams. The cocoon bubbles at his waist and rips apart, a sputtering of tiny black spiders flooding out. The man's body jolts violently around as the swarm consumes him, his gargled screams rife with the skittering of spiderlings which fill his lungs and which he coughs out in dying fits. Horrified, you step back only to see a throng of much larger spiders emerging from around the trees! | The nest is an easy spot, a stretch of winterscape where there's no cold, the white webbing patchy and listing from every tree, every copse, every inch of the place. You march the company right in, weapons drawn, and there you come across the wrapped bodies, their centers blown open and blackened, a spawn of spiderlings sucking on the organs.\n"
"\n"
"  Staring up, you see red eyes flare between the branches of the surrounding trees, the whole arachnidian arboretum come alive, its wardens perched there amongst the brush with their squatted legs indistinguishable from the branches, the enemy hiding in plain sight.

One of the professional soldiers leans out from a tower's crenelations, tears down the fort's banner, and hoists the %noblefamily% sigil in its place to much cheering. | Dead bodies litter the courtyard and they're folded over the walls like wet clothes and some are in the corners with looks of shock on their faces and you see some blackened shapes wiry and crooked in the ruins of a burnt stable and amongst these dead men are horses and pigs and dogs and even fray feathered birds that all managed to get sucked into the violence which visited this place with unstoppable inertia.\n"

One of his men raises the banner of %noblefamily% so that all may see who won the battle this day. | All around you are the bodies of %objective%'s defenders.

You watch as one of %commander%'s soldiers unfurls their banner over one of the towers so at least that's nice. | A few pockets of fighting remain.

"Groaning with heavy oaken deliberation, the ram sails forward and slams against the gate. It fractures in the middle and through the gap you can see %objective%'s defenders waiting on the other side for you. Another order, another ramming. This time it batters straight through the gate, breaking the hinges and causing each door to fall away in a spray of splinters and metal. Arms at the ready, you and all the men rush through to the other side. | With a retinue of the commander's men, the %companyname% pushes a hooded battering ram toward the gates of %objective%. A few defenders bark down at you with jeers.%SPEECH_ON%{Aren't you going to take us out to dinner first? | Hmm, nice long ram you got there. Trying to make up for something? | Come and get it ya ugly cunts. | Hope yer praying to the old gods underneath that little roof of yours.}%SPEECH_OFF%Their barbs go quiet as you bump against the gate and, with one swing of the ram, blow it apart. Your men quickly charge through the opening. | Taking a few of the commander's men, you and the %companyname% push a battering ram toward the gate of %objective%. The rooftop bumbles and rattles, disturbingly appearing more shanty than shield. You pray it holds. Arrows plock above while others ricochet with sharp scratches of metal across wood. As you get ever closer to %objective%'s gate, the arrows become rocks, cracking heavily against the war machine's hood. %randombrother% looks over the ram, laughing.%SPEECH_ON%Farkin' hell, man.%SPEECH_OFF%Suddenly a horrid hiss surrounds everyone as though you'd pitched yourself into a den of vipers. All becomes shade as hot oil runs off the sides of the roof. A stream of it pours down a nobleman's back and he cries out, falling forward and becoming a screaming golem of black sludge. You hurriedly order the men to start ramming. Thankfully, it only takes one swing of the ram to blow the gate of %objective% wide open. Your men quickly rush through the opening to battle what few defenders are around to meet you.} | An order to assault %objective% comes down the line. You ready the %companyname%. Your men and %commander%'s push a battering ram toward the fortification's front gate. Arrows sail through the sky, blinkering in the light before whistling into the waves of attackers. Men fall aside in silent collapses, others go down clutching their wounds.\n"
"\n"
" The front gate is quickly bashed open and your men pour through the gap and into a courtyard where some of %objective%'s defenders await. | %commander% gives the order to begin an assault. Your company and his army rush the fortifications, a barrage of siege shots sailing overhead like a darkly hailstorm. The walls are battered and the defenders kept ducking as %commander%'s archers keep the pressure on. You manage to push a battering ram to the front gate and swiftly knock it open. As the %companyname% rushes through, the defenders of %objective% organize themselves in the courtyard to meet you. | The order to assault %objective%'s fortifications comes down the line. Preparations render an apocalyptic scene of a sky darkened with siege shot and arrows. Fires pipe over the walls of %objective% and you see %commander%'s men staging ladders against the crenelations and fighting their way up and in. Meanwhile, you and your men trundle beneath the hood of a battering ram, pushing it to a front gate and quickly knocking it open. As you rush in, defenders fill the courtyard and prepare to fight. | %commander% gives an order to assault %objective%'s fortifications. The assault goes like this: the sky darkens with exchanges of arrows, rattling rains that fly past and ricochet off one another. Siege shots hurtle through the sky like cold comets before bouldering into walls and towers. Defenders fight to push ladders off the crenelations. Attackers climb the ladders, the highest man holding up a shield, the man beneath him stabbing forth with a pike. You and the %companyname% push a rickety battering ram to the front gate, largely left alone under the cover of all this chaos.\n"
"\n"
" When the front gate is bashed open, you and your men rush through just in time to meet a group of defenders who have assembled there. All around the surrounding walls you can see %commander%'s men desperately fighting for control. | Unfortunately, %commander% sees fit to take the fortifications of %objective% head on. You and the %companyname% are charged with taking a battering ram to the front gate. As you push the siege machine through the mud, you notice a man with a steaming cauldron waiting for you just over the gate. You glance around to see soldiers carrying ladders start rushing the walls. They quickly climb up and start battling. When you look back forward, the defender with the burning oil is gone, but there's a pair of legs sticking out of the cauldron.\n"
"\n"
" There is no issue bashing open the front gate and rushing in. You are quickly met by an assembly of defenders while all around the surrounding walls %commander%'s men keep on fighting.}"

"The relentless attacks having finally ceased, %objective% seems safe for now. %employer% should be expecting you and you've no reason to not escape this horrid place as soon as possible. | Well, the town 安全了。 The peasants step about the battlefield with long sticks, poking the earth like pelicans prodding over a pool of most dangerous waters. %randombrother% comes over, cleaning the sludge off his blade, and asks if it is time to return to %employer%. 你点头。 The sooner you can get back for your pay the better. | 战斗结束了。 Among the dead are peasants and militiamen, each attended by survivors who've come to cloak the bodies with sobbing silhouettes. As for the dead undead, well, nobody cares. Those bodies lay as though they came with no purpose and yet departed with a thorough destruction of whatever they touched. The sight of their corpses, and the chaotic nothingness that they represent, is infuriating. Not wanting to be around a second longer, you inform the men to get ready to return to %employer%. | You and the %companyname% stand victorious. The town and its people will survive, for now, and you can return to %employer% for your pay. | The lieutenant of the guard thanks you for saving the town. You mention that the only reason you're here is because someone paid you. 他耸耸肩。%SPEECH_ON%I thank the rains I've no command over, I'll thank you mercenary whether you like it or not.%SPEECH_OFF% | The battle is over and, thankfully, won. Undead bodies spill over the earth in such disarray that they hardly look any different than they did shambling and shuffling just hours ago. But the more recently expired share no such cosmic despondence. They are attended to by wailing women and confused children. You look away from the scene, ordering the %companyname% to prepare its return to %employer%. | A dead man is at your feet, and beside him an undead corpse. It's the strangest of sights, for they are equally put out of this world, but there's life yet in the man. The breath of a recent memory. You saw him swinging to the very end. A noble way for a fighter to go. This corpse, though? What of it? You'll remember it tearing a man's throat out with its bare teeth. Maybe the corpse had a time beyond that moment, a time when it had a family, a time when it was but a kind man doing good in this world. But a throat-ripping monstrosity is all it is now. All it will be remembered as.\n"
"\n"
"The relentless attacks on %objective% have finally ceased, and so you hurry to collect the company and prepare a return to %employer% in %townname%. A good payday is better than another moment of looking at this shite. | What is a dead man? What of a dead man killed twice over? And what of a dead man killed thrice over? Unfortunate. Misfortunate. And a joke.\n"
"\n"
" You walk the battlefield collecting the men of the %companyname%. The town of %objective% is saved for now, and so it's time for you to get back to %employer% in %townname% for a well-earned payday. | %randombrother% wipes his forehead with a cloth, leaving behind a disgusting smear of pale liquid.%SPEECH_ON%Shite, what is that? Is that brain? Sir, would you please?%SPEECH_OFF%You help the man clean himself off. He stands back, arms wide. He's still absolutely covered in blood, guts, and things which may forever be left unknown.%SPEECH_ON%How do I look?%SPEECH_OFF%His grin winks out of the murk like a rind of the moon through a pale sky. You refuse to answer and just tell him to go get the men. With %objective% saved for now, %employer% will be expecting the company back in %townname%, and the company should be expecting a well-earned payday. | %randombrother% comes to your side, together the two of you overlooking the battlefield. Already you can see the families of the dead coming out to find their lost ones. Their wailing is sharp, humanly pitched, a disturbingly welcomed respite from the growling, moaning despondence of the undead. The mercenary claps you on the shoulder.%SPEECH_ON%I'll go and collect the men so we can get on back to %townname% and collect our pay.%SPEECH_OFF% | You watch as women shuffle about the battlefield, holding their dresses up like wetted fowl steering clear of a pond's murk. Of course, once they find what they're looking for, they drop all regard for cleanliness and drop into the filth, wailing and howling, covering themselves in the very horrors which had dispatched their fathers and husbands with infuriating indifference.\n"
"\n"
" %randombrother% 来到了你身边。%SPEECH_ON%Sir, the attacks have ceased and the men are ready to return to %townname%. Just give the word.%SPEECH_OFF% | The lieutenant of the guard comes to your side and shakes your hand. Drying blood cracks and crumbles as you shake. He puts his fists to his hips and nods at the scene.%SPEECH_ON%做的很好，sellsword, and we could not have done it without you。 I'd like to offer you more as thanks, but this town needs all the resources it has to rebuild. I do hope that %employer% pays you all that you are worth.%SPEECH_OFF%You hope so, too.}"

"[img]gfx/ui/events/event_73.png[/img]{You don't step into the ruins so much as clamber, hobbling over the stoneworks like a bat trying to walk upright. Getting to the bottom of the descent, you find what looks like hundreds of clay pots, old chariots more mulch than wood, and metal water basins filled with rusted shields and spears. %randombrother% takes a torch and throws its glow toward the walls. Great murals run along the length of them, great artworks depicting battles you've never heard of. Each step you take seems to unveil another ancient victory until, finally, you come to a giant painted map. There you see a continent overrun with the rule of an empire, gilded its belly, blackened its borders.\n"
"\n"
" %randombrother% walks over, the %item% in hand. You nod and tell him it's time to go. When the two of you turn around, there's a man standing there with a spear in one hand and a shield in the other. Another figure joins him, and another, their steps hitting the stone floor with metal malice. You yell at the mercenary to run and the both of you abandon the ruins in a hurry, the staccato clap of a death march on your heels.\n"
"\n"
" Outside you wheel around and order the men to get ready for a fight. Before the first sellsword can so much as draw his sword, a stream of armored soldiers emerge from the ruins, stack formation, and level their spears at you. Their lieutenant points a decayed finger and speaks with a voice so graveled the words weigh deep in your chest.%SPEECH_ON%The Empire rises. The False King must die.%SPEECH_OFF% | The hole into the ruins is big enough for only one man to get through. You're worried that if everyone goes in at once they'll get stuck and you'll have basically killed the %companyname% off like a bunch of rats in a tight tunnel. Instead, you send in only %randombrother%, who knows what he's after and who you trust can take care of himself were anything to happen.\n"
"\n"
" A few minutes later and you hear the man struggling to crawl back out - and he sounds to be in quite the rush. He yells for help and you and a few other mercenaries stick their hands into the hole. He grabs on and, together, you yank him out. He's got the %item%, but a horrified look on his face. He rolls over and gets up in a hurry.%SPEECH_ON%Hurry! To arms!%SPEECH_OFF%As the mercenaries look into the hole to see if something's coming out, you ask the brother what he saw. He shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%I don't know, sir. It was a mausoleum for people I've never seen before. There was armor and spears all over the place, and murals of a great empire that spanned the whole world over! Painted from floor to ceiling! And... and then they started coming out of the walls. I got out of there as fast I could and...%SPEECH_OFF%Before he can even finish, the rubble where the hole used to be begins to shift and move. Stones roll away and suddenly they all burst outward, a malevolent force standing there - armed and well armored men standing in formation, spears over shields, shuffling forward in uniform steps. Their leader points directly at you.%SPEECH_ON%The Empire rises. The False King must die.%SPEECH_OFF%You've never heard surer fighting words and immediately prepare your men for combat. | You venture into the ruins with %randombrother% at your side. The %item% is easy enough to find, if not a little too easy, but something else catches your attention altogether. There are pots strewn all across the stone floor. Each piece of pottery is a reservoir for spears, and shields hang against the walls on hooks that seem far too ancient and rusted to hold up a cobweb much less a piece of metal. Suddenly, %randombrother% grabs your arm.%SPEECH_ON%Sir. Trouble.%SPEECH_OFF%He points down the halls and you see a man standing there, his movements janky and quick, as though he were breaking in his suit of armor. Suddenly, his head snaps up and stares at you. Despite the fact he's standing so far away, his voice carries as though he were speaking right next to you.%SPEECH_ON%The False King dare trespass here? The Empire will rise again, but first you must die.%SPEECH_OFF%These are fighting words, no doubt, and you grab the sellsword and make a quick escape. You don't get far outside before the mercenaries take up arms without your ordering so: following behind you is a formation of soldiers in armor you've never seen before. They step forward in a formation like a turtle's shell, clasped together with their shields held up to provide protection for the whole unit. Based on the fellow in the ruins, you've no doubt they have come to kill you and the rest of the company! | You enter the ruins and find the %item% easily enough. When you turn around, a tall man in rustic armor is standing there, spear in hand, with vacated eye sockets leering down at you. He swings the spear back.%SPEECH_ON%The False King must die.%SPEECH_OFF%The spear stabs forward. %randombrother% leaps over and deflects it to the ground, the spear tip crackling a couple of sparks off the stone floor. You look at the undead man, a worm coursing through its nose. It speaks again.%SPEECH_ON%The False King must...%SPEECH_OFF%With a quick draw, you unsheathe your sword and cut the ancient dead's head right off. The skull and helmet carrying it clatter and clank off the ground. Before you can investigate, %randombrother% grabs you and tells you to run: more undead figures are appearing out of the walls, shaking free of the granitic grip of a mausoleum's entombment.\n"
"\n"
" Once outside, you order the rest of the company to get into formation. | You send a few of the men into the ruins to find the %item%. All of them return in a hurry, which is unusual as they have a strong inclination to dawdle about to eat up sunlight and earn an easy day's salary. Thankfully, one of them has the relic in hand. Unfortunately, they all look like they've seen a ghost. They need not explain the source of their horror as a group of skittering, armor-clanking undead emerge from the ruins and level their spears at your company. | Arriving at the ruins, you expected some bandits to be footing about. Instead, retrieving the %item% could not have been easier. At least, that's what you thought before a throng of armored undead emerged yelling about the 'False King' and demanding your head on a platter. To arms! | Finding and bagging the %item% was easier than expected. Finding a group of undead men top-heavy with rustic armor and wielding spears in a tighter military formation than even the highest paid army in the realm... not so expected. To arms!}"

Flushing %objective%'s defenders out with fire more than likely saved many lives, but the beyond the gates everything has been cleansed by flames. It will take time to rebuild to its former glory, whatever that was. %commander% seems happy enough as he orders one of his men to raise the flag of %noblefamily% atop one of the towers. Its colorful linens snap crisply amongst shades of floating ash and smoke. | %commander% steps through the ashes of %objective%'s fortifications.%SPEECH_ON%Well, we got it. What's left of it anyway. I'm not going to complain, though. Good job, sellsword.%SPEECH_OFF% | %objective%'s citizens come out to see the remains of their defenses. The women pick through the charred bodies, looking for any sign of their loved ones. Instead, they just find their men burnt to charred and wiry skeletons, faces melted into grim visages that captured their final moments. One of %commander%'s men unfurls %noblefamily%'s banner over the front gate and the commander quickly points to it.%SPEECH_ON%Listen up! See that right there? That is who we are. Now, all you have to do is respect that and everything can go back to normal! Disrespect that, and I will bring you a new normal, got it?%SPEECH_OFF%The crowd of citizens quietly nod their heads. %commander% smiles and it is scarily genuine.%SPEECH_ON%Good! Now, does anyone here make a mean scrambled eggs?%SPEECH_OFF% | You and %commander% enter %objective%'s fortifications to find the coda of a fight for air itself. Blackened shapes, either man or beast, are found having clambered over one another. One man's hand is pulling back the charred remains of another man, his grip stretching back a rope of seared flesh. You cover your mouth to keep from vomiting. %commander% orders his men to raise %noblefamily%'s banner over the front gate. He claps you on the shoulder.%SPEECH_ON%Hey, good job out there, sellsword. You should breathe that stench in, though. It'll help you get used to it faster.%SPEECH_OFF% | You pass through %objective%'s walls holding a cloth to your nose. %commander% walks beside you, holding his head up high with a smugness that is of a stench of its own. Inside %objective%, you find bodies wired together through melted bone and flesh, reared teeth flashing out in gritty grimaces resonating the horrid finality of a burning death. %commander% slaps you on the shoulder.%SPEECH_ON%This was quite a victory, you know that? You should get on back to %employer%, unless you want to help cleanup.%SPEECH_OFF% | You and %commander% enter %objective% with swords raised, but there is nothing to fight: the inferno consumed every living thing. If they weren't burned to death, they can be found caked in the ash and smoke they choked on. %commander% kicks some rubble around, a charred body tumbling over as he does so.%SPEECH_ON%Hell, there ain't much here but the walls.%SPEECH_OFF%He looks at you sternly.%SPEECH_ON%But walls are everything.%SPEECH_OFF%You crouch down and look at the dead man.%SPEECH_ON%Do you think he thought the same?%SPEECH_OFF%The commander shrugs. He quickly turns away and orders one of his men to unfurl %noblefamily%'s banner over the front gate. | You step foot into %objective% and immediately regret it. There are bodies everywhere and not a one is remotely identifiable. The fire turned everything black, even the mud itself. %commander% uses his foot to try and turn over a corpse. Fleshen chips crunch and splinter as though he'd stepped on a thin layer of ice. The man scrunches his nose.%SPEECH_ON%Now that is unsightly, don't you think?%SPEECH_OFF%He turns and lets out a sharp whistle before pointing at one of his soldiers.%SPEECH_ON%You! Raise the %noblefamily% banner over the gates and towers!%SPEECH_OFF%The soldier salutes and rushes off to his duty. %commander% slaps you on the shoulder and says %employer% should be most happy with these results. | There isn't much to recover from %objective%'s fortifications: the fires consumed damn near everything. Those who stayed, burned. Those who rushed to the towers for safety, suffocated. The faces of the dead tell both stories in explicit terms - it was not a good way to go. But %commander% seems happy, ordering his men to start cleaning up and unfurling the %noblefamily% banners. | You pick through the remains of %objective%. The dead bodies draw your eye because you've never seen so many burnt corpses in one place. One is clutching a tiny shape that, upon a closer look, is revealed to be an infant. %commander% walks up and claps you on the shoulder.%SPEECH_ON%Ah, that's a shame. Hey, you did a good job, sellsword. Don't think twice about nothing, got it?%SPEECH_OFF%You nod. The commander smiles briefly before ordering his men to start flying %noblefamily%'s banners everywhere they can. Best to let strangers know that this burnt husk of a fort has new owners. | Inside %objective%, you find all manner of charred chaos. Dead dogs that were set aflame, their chains smoldering them long before the fires could. Horses stuck in stables with their blackened legs stiff in the air. Pigs that broke through their fences and ran wild, no doubt on fire the whole time. A faint aroma of bacon barely undercutting the otherwise horrid stench. There was no escape for any of these creatures.\n"
"\n"
" You open the door to a storage room and find a pile of defenders that suffocated to death. %commander% comes to stand behind you, looking in.%SPEECH_ON%Poor blokes. They look young. Probably stable hands, squires. What a shame.%SPEECH_OFF%The commander leans into the room and knocks some straw off a loaf of bread. He peels the outer layer away to reveal a fresh core.%SPEECH_ON%Hey, you hungry?%SPEECH_OFF%You politely decline the offer.}"

"[img]gfx/ui/events/event_31.png[/img]{You arrive at %commander%'s camp to find his soldiers seemingly relaxed. They're playing dice on a wooden board strewn across the mud, exchanging jokes, and singing songs. All around are banners flying in the wind, most having long lost their once bright colors. A few are tethering the poles of a catapult back together. %commander% himself personally guides you to his command tent. He gives you a drink that tastes like a rat had bathed in it.

The day-to-day presence of so many men has churned the ground into mud. A few of the men crank the spokes of a shoddy, shaky catapult. They slam a wormy cow's head into the bucket and slacken the rope spring until the pole of the war machine shoots forward, launching a spinning, bleeding black head toward the fortifications. It caroms off a crenelated bastion before rolling a sick stain down the walls. One of the defenders yells back.%SPEECH_ON%Nice shot, ya twats!%SPEECH_OFF%%commander% claps you on the shoulder. He's grinning.%SPEECH_ON%Welcome to the front, sellsword. The presence of you and your men is much appreciated. %objective% is cut off, but they refuse to surrender and remain feisty despite the hunger in their bellies. But that hunger... it weakens them. When the time is right, I will begin an assault, all I need is for you to be ready.%SPEECH_OFF% | %commander% welcomes you to the front. He informs you that the defenders of %objective% are tired, running low on supplies, and are about ready to break. Given these facts, he is preparing a final assault and simply needs the men of the %companyname% to be ready when the time comes. | The siege at %objective% looks more like the recreation in a large play than the efforts of a concentrated war effort. Both sides are in a state of miserable inadequacy, hurling insults back and forth over the walls, and in between quietly cursing the fact they had the poor luck to be stuck in this hellish situation. %commander%, though, comes to you with a cheery spark in his eyes.%SPEECH_ON%Ah, mercenaries. Let me fill you in on what is going on. We have cut off the food supplies to %objective% and a few nights ago one of our agents managed to burn their granary to the ground. They are hungry and soon they will be dying. Because we are so pressed for time, I'm organizing an all-out assault to bring this siege to a quick end. Just be ready when the time comes.%SPEECH_OFF% | You come to %objective% to see the fortifications standing silhouetted against the horizon and %commander% staring through a pair of leather-wrapped ocular lenses, grimacing angrily at what he's glassing. He hands you the device and you take a look.\n"

" The first thing you see is a man's ass bobbing up and down as he pats it with both hands. The soldier beside him is slackjawed and crosseyed as he yanks at his bits.

I need you and the men of the %companyname% to be ready when the order comes.%SPEECH_OFF% | %commander% welcomes you to the outskirts of %objective% where his siege camp has been built. Rows of tents are filled with tired and grumbly men. They cook stews out of pots that have never been cleaned, and exchange jokes that were never clean to begin with. In the distance, diligent defenders of %objective% stare over their crenelations. The commander brings you to his tent and explains the situation.%SPEECH_ON%%objective% is out of food and starving. Unfortunately, I'm out of time. We need to assault this damned place soon and I mean real farkin' soon. When the time comes, and it will come sellsword, I need you to be ready.%SPEECH_OFF% | The outskirts of %objective% has become littered with tents. One of %commander%'s bodyguards marches you through the siege city. Grumbly professional soldiers eye you with suspicion. %commander%, however, cheerily welcomes you to his tent. As you step in, you see a man hanging by both hands, his feet dangling off the ground. A second man is cleaning a knife in a bucket of reddened water. %commander% throws his hand toward the prisoner.%SPEECH_ON%Ah, sellsword. You just missed the action.%SPEECH_OFF%You ask what he was doing. The commander walks to the prisoner and cups him by the chin, lifting a tired and exhausted head.%SPEECH_ON%I was getting answers. %objective% is about to fall, but I don't have the time to sit around and wait for that to happen. I will be assaulting the fortifications soon and when I do, I need you and your men at the ready.%SPEECH_OFF% | You come to %commander%'s siege camp to find soldiers loading a net of heads into a catapult and launching it over %objective%'s fortifications. The commander himself comes to your side, soaking in the scene with a wide and satisfied smile.%SPEECH_ON%You know, some of those heads were of our own, but I figured the gits over the walls wouldn't be able to tell the difference. It's not about whose head, but how many, ya know? Come, sellsword.%SPEECH_OFF%He guides you to his command tent and there lays out a map.%SPEECH_ON%The defenders are tired and recent information tells me that they are almost out of food and beginning to fight over scraps. But I do not have the time for them to realize the futility of their situation, I must force it upon them. We are to begin an assault sometime soon. You need to be there when the order comes.%SPEECH_OFF% | As you enter %commander%'s camp, a few of his soldiers spit on one of your men and a brawl quickly breaks out. Thankfully, the commander himself appears to put things at ease. He quickly guides you to his tent and there you talk while your men stand outside.%SPEECH_ON%I must apologize for the actions of my men. Tempers run razor thin after you've been standing and sleeping in mud, day after day, while your enemies sleep in beds and hurl insults over their walls.\n"
"\n"
"Luckily, one of my agents managed to burn down %objective%'s granary and stocks and the fort is without supplies. The defenders have been going hungry, but I fear my men will hardly bother to stand out here for long. I also worry that reinforcements might be coming to try and lift the siege. All of this means one thing... I'm going to order an assault. The plans are currently being drawn, I just need you ready for when the order comes.%SPEECH_OFF%}"

" You whistle at a man standing in a bell tower and point to the sighting. He straightens up so fast his metal cap falls off and clanks down the stone tower. He hurriedly rings the bell, the great bongs silencing the cruel canine commotion below. Man and mongrel stop to look up, a dreary silence settling over them all. Slowly, the din of death, groaning and growling, seeps into the very air. The lieutenant of the guards jumps into the scene, weapon already drawn out.%SPEECH_ON%To arms, men! To arms!%SPEECH_OFF% | One undead corpse shambles outside the wall of %objective%. The guards take turns trying to shoot it with arrows.%SPEECH_ON%Take a look at that, got 'im in the foot!%SPEECH_OFF%Another guard readies his shot.%SPEECH_ON%He's still walking.

The corpse's balance shifts momentarily, pausing, then continues on as though it just remembered what it set out to do. Another guardsman shakes his head and readies his shot. He closes one eye, then slowly opens it. His hands start to shake and the arrow shaft rattles against the wooden bow.%SPEECH_ON%T-t-to... uh, to arms! Ring the alarms!%SPEECH_OFF%You look over the walls and see a sea of grey surfacing on the horizon, bobbing and trundling. The undead are attacking! | The town is quiet, the soft crackles and pops of a fire filling the muted air. You watch as men burn a rat on a spit and start slicing off chunks to share. Seeing enough, you go up the walls to find the lieutenant of the guards eyeing the horizon with a scope. He lowers it grimly.%SPEECH_ON%Well fark me arseways, they're coming.%SPEECH_OFF%He hands you the glass and you take a look. A throng of fish-eyed, warped-looking undead are shambling toward %objective%.

Get up there, cut him free, and take his post!%SPEECH_OFF%Another guardsman grunts and does as told, but when he gets atop the guard he stops following any orders. Instead, he starts hysterically calling out.%SPEECH_ON%Sir! Sir! They're coming! All them pale folk, they're comin'!%SPEECH_OFF%The lieutenant yells at his men to prepare for battle, and you yours. The man turns to you with a look of hopefulness.%SPEECH_ON%Whatever they're paying ya, I hope yer worth every crown, sellsword.%SPEECH_OFF% | One of the guards has found a den of rats which is cause for depressingly incredible celebration. As the townsfolk cheer and weep, and the shrill cries of the rodents go into spits and fires, the lieutenant of the guards comes over. He observes the scene with a smile, but it fades when a high-pitched scream breaks the air. Everyone turns to the walls where one of the guards is pointing toward the horizon. Even from where you're standing you can see the whites in his frightened eyes.%SPEECH_ON%The dead are comin'! They're comin' to kill us all! We ain't have enough men!%SPEECH_OFF%The lieutenant tells the man to grow some balls, then quietly turns to you.%SPEECH_ON%Prepare your men, sellsword, and prove you're worth whatever they're paying ya.%SPEECH_OFF% | A guard was caught trying to desert. He's on his knees while the lieutenant of the guards marches back and forth with disappointed appraisal.%SPEECH_ON%We can't spare a man, and you choose to do this to us?%SPEECH_OFF%One of the townsman throws a clop of mud which sails wide, but the intention is clear.%SPEECH_ON%Bury 'im alive!

"只怕那个。那个还有马。%SPEECH_OFF%贵族笑了。%SPEECH_ON%好，行吧。这里是一张地图。 "
"你能看到上面标了“%objective1%”和“%objective2%”。我的侦察兵相信亡灵躲在那里。 很合理，毕竟那里一开始就是我们放死者的地方。 "
"去这两个地方，摧毁它们，然后回来拿你的报酬。足够简单，对吧？%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% "
"在他的门口拿着张地图欢迎你。%SPEECH_ON%“%objective1%”和“%objective2%”，清晰的标了出来，看到了吗？ 你当然看得到。"
" 我的小鸟们说大量邪恶事物正从这两个地方涌出来。 如果是真的，那我需要一个无畏，善于杀戮的人去这两个地方摧毁那里的一切。 "
"我相信你就是这样一个人。是吗？%SPEECH_OFF% |  一个全副武装，但是满面愁容的人离开了 %employer%的房间。 "
"你进去的时候，贵族招手叫你到他的桌边看看地图。%SPEECH_ON%你不害怕死者，对吗？ 亡灵呢？不？ "
"完美。“%objective1%”在那儿，还有“%objective2%”那儿。 "
"去这两个地方，摧毁它们，并给刚才走出去的懦夫看看真男人是怎么办事的。%SPEECH_OFF%你竖起一根手指试图修正。%SPEECH_ON%一个好价钱买来的真正的男人。%SPEECH_OFF%"

" 什么样的生物会把他们的死者带去些地方，好地方，并埋起来？ 多么华而不实。多么不合逻辑。 这样一来，亡者归来，有什么值得惊讶的？ "
"或许他们是因为我们破坏了自然法则在缠扰我们。%SPEECH_OFF%他丢给你一个卷轴，上面画着一张细致的地图。 "
"两个点被标记了出来。%SPEECH_ON%“%objective1%”和“%objective2%”。我需要你去这两个地方，摧毁它们，然后回来。 "
"对于你的职业而言足够简单，对吗？%SPEECH_OFF% | 你看到 %employer% "
"摇着头用笔划过一张地图。%SPEECH_ON%“%objective1%”和“%objective2%”，两个离这并不远的粪坑需要被摧毁。 "
"当然，它们是亡者，然后，亡灵的家。 它们可没让我们消停过而且现在，好吧，这些尸体还能安息吗？ 谁知道呢。但是杀光它们，明白了吗？%SPEECH_OFF%"
" | %employer% 在照看一堆笼子里的鸟。 有些绕着它们的牢房煽动翅膀，撞着笼子。 贵族捡起一只鸟的尸体，腿僵直。 "

"我的侦察兵报告，通过这些小鸟，这些地方有亡灵聚集，或许是个源头，或是个行动基地，如果一群尸体有能力形成这样的组织。%SPEECH_OFF%他开始往鸟窝里丢鸟食籽。"
" 几只鸟盯着饲料并决定不去吃它，拒绝去偷自然界最伟大的馈赠。 另一边，剪了翅膀的鸟则在啄着。%employer% "
"转身向你，拍打着擦干净手。%SPEECH_ON%所以，我们成交吗？%SPEECH_OFF% | 你发现 %employer% "
"被他的卫兵围起来，全都看着房间中间的一具尸体。 一股恶臭在贵族之前迎接了你。 "
"一个瘴气从尸体上飘浮下来，色调呈钝灰色就好像风道间的一堆尘埃。%SPEECH_ON%佣兵！很高兴见到你！ 如果你可以，无视这场闹剧。 "
"我们遇到了个麻烦，一个卫兵自杀了，而且，好吧，在活过来。 也许，一场复杂的刺杀计划？ 现在这个世道很难说。 "
"过来，我有些东西给你。%SPEECH_OFF%他招手让你上前，伸出来的手里拿着一张卷轴。 你拿上它摊开了地图。 "
"他解释了下。%SPEECH_ON%“%objective1%”和“%objective2%”，如果你认得出来它们，是我们认为的亡灵们的源头。 "
"我需要一个像你一样的，嗯，钢铁般身材的人去那两个地方解决他们。 希望你对这个活感兴趣。%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% "
"欢迎你进入他的房间，但一个卫兵用长柄的刃检查了下你的脖子。 "
"你保持镇定，贵族快速命令他的手下退下。贵族道歉。%SPEECH_ON%抱歉发生了这种不幸的事情，但是人们都很紧张。 "
"有个晚上他们中的一个在睡梦中死了并且，好吧，他回来了。 "
"一个食尸鬼一样咆哮的野兽在任何人明白发生了什么之前杀死了三个人。%SPEECH_OFF%你挠了挠下巴，说你本来就需要好好刮下胡子的。%employer%"
" 带着微笑点头。%SPEECH_ON%嗯，这就是我喜欢你的地方，佣兵。 总是很有精神。 看看我这里的这张地图。 "
"看到这些地点了吗？“%objective1%”和“%objective2%”，农民们是这么称呼它们的。 "
"我们有理由相信这两个地方都有强大的力量正供给着亡灵大军。 我需要一个你这样身材和决心的人去这两个地方并摧毁它们。 "
"有兴趣吗，雇佣兵？%SPEECH_OFF% | 你发现 %employer% 倚在椅子上。 他丢给你一张地图。%SPEECH_ON%读它，了解它。 "
"看到“%objective1%”和“%objective2%”了吗？我的密探相信这两个地方有强大的力量在支撑着亡灵。 "
"我想它们只是充满了一大堆好给亡灵们复活的尸体的地方。 不论如何，我需要你去这两个地方，摧毁它们，然后回来找我。 "
