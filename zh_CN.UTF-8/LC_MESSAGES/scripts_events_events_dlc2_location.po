The gibbering greenskins didn't add to the terrain, they desecrated the place whole, putting mines where trees used to be, constructing a maze of rusted shanties and lean-tos, raising cultish totems and digging primitive sacrificial pits, piling unused timber as though the mutilation of the mountain was not truly finished without blatant waste.\n"

" But beyond the goblin rubbish does stand a central core of the city, a number of towers unambiguously set apart from the riffraff. These are clearly ancient requisitions, the stonework being unlike anything you've ever seen and surely beyond the greenskin's scope of construct. The goblins walking amongst the walls are upright and boastful as though invigorated by being allowed to stride such hallowed grounds. Nestled inside the fortress seem to be of some sort of higher nobility, well dressed goblins with servants mucking about, which means the same thing it does when it comes to humans: there's good loot to be had.\n"
