In that moment, a barkeep will be asked about mercenaries and he'll pause, thinking it over, and then your face will fade from his memory and your name will pass with it. He will shrug and pour another drink. | As the light leaves your world, you hope that perhaps the name of the %companyname% will live on and that people will remember what they did. They won't. | As the pain seizes your body, you simply let the corporeal world go, retreating into your own mind, barricading yourself there, desperately seeking any good reason for why you chose this life, because it seems readily obvious now that the life you chose also chose your death. | The %companyname% is dead to the last man, your corpse amongst the bodies, no rank or order to be followed now. Was it fated? In your death, will others rise? Or will the world be as it always has been? | The cruel finality you have doled out upon others has returned in totality, claiming the lives of the entirety of the %companyname%. Few will speak of you, and certainly no more than the crows who squawk out claims to your corpses. With no shortage of work for hired swords in this world, there is always the next mercenary band to take their place... | The %companyname% has been annihilated to the last brother. Looters now pick through the bodies, calling out what they find with excited surprise. You've made their day, a shame it had to happen in your last.}"
