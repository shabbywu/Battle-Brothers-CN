"{[img]gfx/ui/events/event_05.png[/img]{%anatomist% is sitting near to the campfire. Almost too close. You pull him back a ways so he doesn't burn himself. He looks up, his face dotted with pustules and slathered in the grease of ones which have already popped.%SPEECH_ON%I'm beginning to wonder if I made a great mistake in drinking that potion.%SPEECH_OFF%He scoots back toward the flames, and there's a sense in his eyes that he wants to pitch himself into it. You can't do much for him, mostly because he looks awfully gross at the moment and you'd rather not touch him again. | You find %anatomist% standing beside the company wagon with a sleeve unfurled and his finger picking at some strange markings there. Curious, you ask if they are birthmarks. The anatomist turns, shaking his head. He lifts up his shirt to show that these markings are all over his body, mottling the flesh with unsightly colors which look rough to the touch, like scabs that cannot be peeled.%SPEECH_ON%The potion I drank did this and I know not what to with myself.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and tell him it'll surely get better. He sighs and simply lowers his shirt and looks away. | %anatomist% stands over a bucket of water, looking at his darkened reflection in it. He sighs. You ask how he is doing, and he turns to reveal horrific rashes and boils upon his skin.%SPEECH_ON%I am not doing so well, to be honest. The concoction I imbibed seems to have had a gravely ill-effect on me, though I am being perhaps a little giving with my vocabulary there. I will survive, but it has wounded me in ways that are not just of the skin and the body, but of the mind. I thought myself distanced from such matters, but now, seeing my horrible face...I am in a state of perpetual unease.%SPEECH_OFF%You grab his shoulder and give it a squeeze, then pat him on the back and make some recommendations like he should drink some water and of course to not feel bad. You weren't ever that great at consoling other men, much less ones suffering from terrible maladies sprung from scientific madness. | %anatomist% the anatomist is in a despondent state. The potion he made, and was in such a hurry to drink, has resulted in his entire body being overcome with maladies ranging from rashes to boils to what appear to be unusual spasms and plenty of snot from the nose. You assure him that he will get better, but his horrific appearance is taking a toll on him. | The strange concoctions %anatomist% the anatomist has been making, are strange concoctions that he has also been drinking. Unsurprisingly, the effects have not been good: rashes, infections, smells, hair falling out, and more. While on the outside he proclaims that what he is doing is in the name of science, you can tell that all these maladies and disfigurations are debilitating to the man's morale. You can only hope he gets better with time. | Matters of science, which are far outside your understanding, always do seem to come with risks. You remember as a child that your friend took the risk of swinging out on a rope into a river, and by happenstance you all found out just how much weight a branch can hold while in the throes of Fall.\n"
"\n"
"Now, it seems %anatomist% the anatomist is finding out the debilitating nature of drinking one of his bizarre potions. He is overwhelmed with rashes and infections, and for some reason he is a siren to ants, who for who knows what reason now love to crawl on him at all hours of day and night. Hopefully, with time, these maladies will depart, and hopefully take the damned ants with them. | You always knew the anatomists to be a bit wrong in the head, but the way they've been creating potions and drinking them has really floored you. Water alone can be poisonous if sipped from the wrong cup, nevermind wholesale concoctions which are distilled in the mire of whatever scientific notions the anatomists are carrying that day. Naturally, it isn't long until one of the eggheads, %anatomist%, falls ill. He is still capable of moving and day-to-day tasks, but the giant warts and leaking pustules makes him a horror to look at, and though he may see himself distanced from society, you've little doubt that walking around looking like a rag that's mopped up pigshite is healthy for the mind and spirit. Hopefully, with a bit of time, he might get better. | %anatomist% isn't necessarily sick from drinking his potions. After all, he is still able to move and get around, and even fight if necessary. But he is certainly affected by said potions in a manner most unsightly. Great boils have appeared on his cheeks, and occasionally his eyes spring from their sockets and he has to push them back in which is something you wished you hadn't seen. Strings of drool come down the corners of his lips and his nostril is home to snails of snot and boogers and blood. As you can imagine, he is rather down about the whole looking uglier than a dead pig carcass-thing, but you've faith that in good time he will get better.}"

"{[img]gfx/ui/events/event_05.png[/img]{%anatomist%坐在篝火旁边，离火有些近。你把他拉开一些，以免他烧着自己。他抬起头，脸上布满了疱疹，并且涂了一些已经爆破的脓油。%SPEECH_ON%我现在开始怀疑喝那剂药是不是个巨大的错误。%SPEECH_OFF%他向火移动，眼中似乎有一种想要投身其中的欲望。你没办法帮他太多，大多数是因为他此刻看起来相当恶心，你宁愿不再碰他。 | 你在战团大篷车旁发现%anatomist%站着，卷起袖子用手指在一些奇怪的标记上戳。你好奇地问他这是不是胎记。解剖学家转过身来摇头。他抬起衣服，展示了他全身上下的这些标记，肉上有着不好看的颜色，感觉粗糙，像是无法撕下的痂，让人很不舒服。%SPEECH_ON%我喝的药水导致了这个结果，而我不知道该如何是好。%SPEECH_OFF%你点点头，告诉他一定会好起来的。他叹了口气，简单地放下衣服，扭头离开。 | %anatomist%站在水桶边，看着自己的黑暗反射，叹了口气。你问他最近怎么样，他转身露出了皮肤上可怕的皮疹和疮。%SPEECH_ON%老实说，情况不太好。我饮用的药物似乎对我产生了严重的影响，尽管我的措辞可能有些大。我会活下去，但这伤害不仅仅是对肌肤和身体，还是对精神。我之前以为自己与此无关，但现在，看到自己可怕的脸……我感到无尽的不安。%SPEECH_OFF%你拍了拍他的肩膀，向他点头，提建议说他应该喝些水，当然不要难过。你并不擅长安慰别人，更别说安慰那些遭受疯狂科学的可怕疾病折磨的人了。 | %anatomist%解剖学家处于一种失落的状态中。他制造的药水，却被迫饮用，导致整个身体充满了从皮疹到疮痍再到异常痉挛和不断涌出鼻涕的恶疾。你向他保证他会好起来的，但他的可怕外表正在对他造成影响。 | %anatomist%解剖学家制造的奇怪配方，都是他自己饮用的。毫不意外的是，影响并不好：皮肤起疹子，感染，臭味，脱发等等等等。尽管他在外面宣称他的行为是为了科学，但你能看出这些病症和变形对他的士气造成了打击。你只能希望他能在一定的时间内恢复过来。 | 超出你理解范围的科学问题总是伴随着风险。你记得小时候你的朋友冒险用草绳荡秋千，而意外的是你们却发现树枝在摇晃的时候能承受多少重量。\n"
"\n"
"现在，看来%anatomist%解剖学家正在尝试从喝下他自己制作的奇怪药物中得到克服疾病的滋味。他的脸上长满了恶心的疙瘩和脓包，而蚂蚁也不知道出于什么原因为什么变成了有吸引力的磁铁，整天都在他身上爬。希望这些疾病会随着时间的推移离开他，也希望这些可恶的蚂蚁跟着消失。 | 你一直都知道解剖学家有点神经质，但他们制造药剂并饮用的方法真的让你吃惊。如果没有从正确的杯子小口地啜饮就有可能中毒，更不用说这些解剖学家从科学概念的泥沼中提炼的一系列药水了。自然而然，没过多久，其中一个蛋头，%anatomist%，就生病了。他仍然能够行动和做日常任务，但巨大的瘤子和不断渗出脓液的疱疹让他看上去很可怕。尽管他也认为自己与社会疏离，你毫不怀疑，像粘了猪粪的抹布四处走动对心灵和精神不利。希望随着时间的推移，他能够恢复过来。 | %anatomist%解剖学家并不是因为饮用他自己的药水而生病了。毕竟，他仍然能够行动、四处走动，甚至有必要的时候还能战斗。但他的身体却显然受到了药物的影响，并变得非常丑陋。他脸颊上长出了大疙瘩，眼睛偶尔从眼窝中弹出，需要用力推回去，这是你不愿看到的。唾液在嘴角滴下，鼻孔里满是鼻涕、鼻屎和血。你可以想象，他现在的样子比死猪的尸体还难看。但你相信，随着时间的推移，他会恢复好转。}"

Instead, everything has a purpose. In a sense, and through the old gods, we can trust that these elements have in actuality a divine purpose. Yet, some of my peers have found bones of creatures that have not once been seen in the flesh. It appears that these entities have disappeared entirely. It begs the question: does such evidence entail that we, ourselves, will one day disappear? An affirmative on that front suggests, then, that the divinities above are not actually weighing their visions in our favor. We walk under the gaze of mere happenstance. A terrible thought, indeed.%SPEECH_OFF%Curious, you ask what these mysterious monsters looked like. The anatomist opens the red book and shows you a drawing.%SPEECH_ON%They are quite similar to humans, but larger with implied bulkiness around the neck and shoulders. The skulls carry these notches, similar to that of horns, and the spinal columns have extra vertebrae with three of them near the top broadening out, as if they were holding onto something, something that would extend far from the body. See? Here? The back is almost like a bony mantle.%SPEECH_OFF%Interesting. You ask the anatomist if he's seen one of these skeletons for himself, and he says no. He says he's only seen it in the text. You ask if he paid for this text and he says he did. You ask him if perhaps the notion of old, bizarre monsters was but a mere sales pitch to get him to buy a book of bullshit. The anatomist ponders for a time. He nods and agrees that it is likely that he has purchased a spoof.

He sees these horrific scars and ever growing pustules as evidence that he is on the right path. In some way, he is right. These strange changes have made him a far superior fighter than he was before, which is saying a lot for you personally had no hope that these foolish eggheads ever had a shot of becoming even competent fighters at best. Whatever fears and worries he had prior are now gone entirely, replaced by a renewed sense of purpose and desire to do more. | %anatomist% has stopped moping around worrying about his scars and horrible appearance. It seems he has made peace with how he looks now, or possibly he has simply become so ingratiated with the godawful smell emanating from every part of him that he no longer notices. While his stink brings you to nearly vomit every time you're near him, at the very least he has recovered from the dourness which was occupying his every waking minute. Maybe now he can continue on his righteous path to scientific discovery, or however else he put it. | It is hard to come to terms with who you are and, despite the superficiality, it is even more difficult to make peace with how you look. This is even more true when how you look was not the manner in which you were born, but shaped by the actions you took in life. If your own decisions brought you to this newfound state, you have only your own choices to dwell upon for the rest of your life. You've seen it many a time, particularly with sellswords who lose their ears, noses, lips, and worse. It can take a long time for a man to come to peace with his newformed circumstances, and %anatomist% was no different. But come to peace he has. Whatever horrific scars and mutations he has suffered from his own actions are no more - at least mentally. He has moved on and is ready to continue his path in this world as someone seeking scientific endeavors, and the great risks to himself that those endeavors might one day pose. | %anatomist% has come to terms with his new appearances. At first, his body's reactions to the potions and concoctions he's been imbibing were so disturbing that he reeled into a shell of his former self. You could hardly blame him, for he did and does look quite hideous. But after a while, you simply realize that life goes on, and if nothing can be done about it then nothing can be done about it. And, at the very least, the real purpose of the choices made were to satisfy scientific inquiries, and it seems re-realizing that has revivified %anatomist%'s sense of purpose. He is still ungainly and disgusting and you have a hard time looking at him, but least he's happier now. | Once wounded by maladies and disfigurements, %anatomist% the anatomist is starting to look a lot better now. That is to say, he has come to realize that there is little he can do about his physical appearance which is, to be terse, still something that takes courage and willpower to just look at. But the man has remembered the true reason he sought the concoctions and strange mixtures and tinctures which have turned him into a walking and talking monstrosity, and that reason is a matter of scientific endeavor. The anatomist is now a happier man and as long as he can be kept far away from even the smallest of mirrors you imagine that can more or less remain the case. | %anatomist%'s habit of sucking down any every potion he concocts did eventually come to bite him in the ass. His last imbibement when horribly wrong, turning his face into fleshy dough, and arising across his skin all manner of bumps and bruises and pustules and pusses. Naturally, these changes had a deep morale impact on the man. But, finally, he has gotten over it. He is still a walking, talking monstrosity in every sense of the word, but on the inside he is at peace with it, and what's on the inside is what counts. Or at least it better count, because what's on the outside you can barely muster the courage to look at. | %anatomist% the anatomist calls the changes to his body 'mutations', which must be some sort of egghead word for looking like shite. For a while, his appearance was a drag on his day to day life. You can hardly blame him, he inflicted these maladies upon himself which is always far worse than when the world does it to you and leaves little doubt as to how you could have unfarked yourself. Thankfully, the anatomist has gotten over his depression and angst about his horrendous appearance. He might even be more willing than ever to keep imbibing his potions and concoctions. Surely he can't look much worse than he already does and at a certain point of looking completely hideous even the ladyfolk take a turn, like seeing a dog so mangy and decrepit that one can't help but pet it out of curiosity. | After he drank a number of questionable potions, %anatomist% the anatomist's body began to change and, like any grown man, change at that age is rarely a good thing. His face became disfigured, his body mottled with sores and scars. For a time, the anatomist fell into a deep depression over the matter and you wondered if he had been irreversibly damaged not just on the outside, but the inside as well. Thankfully, it is the morale of a man that can be the hardest to break. %anatomist% has come to terms with his new appearance. It's not as though there is much he can do about it, and he now sees it as a sort of fundamental rite by fire that he is the way he is, and that he has helped pursue the scientific endeavors which brought him to these lands in the first place.

The Oathtaker straightens up, staring at you with a sincere look of offense.%SPEECH_ON%Captain, it matters not how he died, or even when or why or to whom, and maybe there even isn't a whom, but what matters is that he was on the Oath of the Final Path, and so we are also with him, and will be to the end. We are not just Oathtakers, but the Final Oathtakers.%SPEECH_OFF%He turns around, flicking a bug off the bone and then cleaning the skull as though it had been profaned by the insect's steps.%SPEECH_ON%This is a grand experience we are undertaking here captain, but sometimes I think you're just along for the ride.%SPEECH_OFF%It is at the very least a grand experience in deepening your pockets.

The man suddenly jumps to his feet and nods.%SPEECH_ON%Such guidance is much appreciated, Young Anselm.%SPEECH_OFF%A part of you wishes you could look at a young lad's skull for guidance and actually find it, but the only thing you take from Young Anselm's bony visage is an empty stare. | The company has had its up and downs, but Young Anselm is still seen as its primary piety purveyor. You have to admit, sometimes you find yourself staring at the skull with a bit of contempt. Despite you leading the band, and despite you leading it quite well, much of the company's successes are given to the skull. When the men need help, they often go to the skull just as well, skipping right past their captain. %oathtaker% is an example of this, having had a rough go lately but, instead of talking to you, you find him scooping up Young Anselm for some bony counsel on Oathtaking matters. You sometimes dream of taking the First Oathtaker's dome and skipping it across a lake like a rock. | Young Anselm's skull is a touchstone for the most faithful of the Oathtakers, a source of knowledge and guidance and more, all springing out from a silent, bony vessel. %oathtaker%, who has been feeling rather down and out about his past few days, is given access to the skull. Even in this brief keeping, he is renewed in his belief in the Oaths. | You set Young Anselm's skull onto a stick and start spinning it, the bone rattling as it goes round and round, the hollow clatter horribly amusing. %oathtaker% comes through the bushes asking something and you grab the skull and set it down in an instant. The Oathtaker looks at you, the stick, the skull, then back to you. He clears his throat and explains he's been having a rough go of it the past few days. For guidance, and out of laziness, you hand him Young Anselm's skull, telling him to find within the First Oathtaker a revivification of his vitality, a renewal of his faiths, and a resurgence of his courage. The man nods dutifully.%SPEECH_ON%Young Anselm might be the First Oathtaker, but I still believe you are wise beyond your years, captain. I should have seen to Anselm in the first place!%SPEECH_OFF% | You got Young Anselm's skull set on a stump and are throwing pebbles through the eyesockets. One swooshes right through the hole and you pump your fist. Just then, %oathtaker% comes around. He looks at you, your clenched fist, and Young Anselm. The Oathtaker nods.%SPEECH_ON%If even a cynic such as you may be given courage by Young Anselm, then surely the First Oathtaker's abilities go beyond what even I believed. I will leave you alone so that you may find further guidance from Young Anselm.%SPEECH_OFF%Nodding, you thank the Oathtaker, but after he leaves you return to the sport. Unfortunately, all you can muster is plinking pebble after pebble off Anselm's dome. It seems you've lost the touch of the toss. | You have a thick stick in hand and are tossing rocks into the air and slamming them off into the distance. Each crack is deep and pleasing, and the sight of the stones sailing immensely satisfying. As you lean down to pick up another stone, you see Young Anselm's skull there, staring up at you. Naturally, you take it up, weighing it one hand. It's so light. You toss it up and smash it with the stick, fragments of skull spiraling outward in every direction, the fine bonemeal powdering the air around you as though you'd cast a magic trick. Suddenly, you feel something in your side, and this world snaps away and you blink awake to %oathtaker% prodding you with his toe. Blinking your eyes, you realize you dozed off near the campfire. The Oathtaker sets a skull down beside you and nods.%SPEECH_ON%I sought counsel with Young Anselm and found it, captain, but seeing that you were sweating in your sleep I thought maybe you would like a moment with the First Oathtaker as well.%SPEECH_OFF%The man turns and leaves and you're left alone with the skull. It stares at you knowingly. A little too knowingly. You turn the head to look elsewhere and then go back to sleep. | %oathtaker% has had a rough go of it the past few days. You bring him Young Anselm's skull and tell him to sit with his thoughts, and to reflect on the Oaths. The man nods, and just a few minutes later he comes to you, skull in hand.%SPEECH_ON%You were right, captain. I had strayed from the path, but through the First Oathtaker's guidance I have found it again.%SPEECH_OFF% | Young Anselm's skull is starting to look a little ragged. Pieces of grass, mud, couple of bugs, all these things are smattered onto the bone. %oathtaker% comes up asking some inane question about inventory. You cut him off and hand him the skull and tell him to clean it. He nods, staring at the skull as though it were a pound of pure gold. He finishes the job within ten minutes, and when he gets back his disposition is entirely fresh, himself admitting that time alone with Young Anselm invigorated him, and reminded him why he took to the Oathtakers in the first place. That's all well and good, but the priority here is that he's also forgotten to talk to you about inventory which is fantastic.}"
