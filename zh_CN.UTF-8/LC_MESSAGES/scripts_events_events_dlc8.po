Instead, everything has a purpose. In a sense, and through the old gods, we can trust that these elements have in actuality a divine purpose. Yet, some of my peers have found bones of creatures that have not once been seen in the flesh. It appears that these entities have disappeared entirely. It begs the question: does such evidence entail that we, ourselves, will one day disappear?

If he decided not to kill her, and the village rescinded its agreement, then he'd later be compelled to simply do the bidding of every village to prevent that situation from happening again. Through a series of gentle explanations you show that the village is in danger of displaying for all that it is untrustworthy, and that by the virtue of the example it sets it will only be set upon by charlatans and miscreants with aims on their gold and not on completing a task as asked.

Unfortunately, all you can muster is plinking pebble after pebble off Anselm's dome. It seems you've lost the touch of the toss. | You have a thick stick in hand and are tossing rocks into the air and slamming them off into the distance. Each crack is deep and pleasing, and the sight of the stones sailing immensely satisfying. As you lean down to pick up  stone, you see Young Anselm's skull there, staring up at you. Naturally, you take it up, weighing it one hand. It's so light. You toss it up and smash it with the stick, fragments of skull spiraling outward in every direction, the fine bonemeal powdering the air around you as though you'd cast a magic trick. Suddenly, you feel something in your side, and this world snaps away and you blink awake to %oathtaker% prodding you with his toe. Blinking your eyes, you realize you dozed off near the campfire. The Oathtaker sets a skull down beside you and nods.%SPEECH_ON%I sought counsel with Young Anselm and found it, captain, but seeing that you were sweating in your sleep I thought maybe you would like a moment with the First Oathtaker as well.%SPEECH_OFF%The man turns and leaves and you're left alone with the skull. It stares at you knowingly. A little too knowingly. You turn the head to look elsewhere and then go back to sleep. | %oathtaker% has had a rough go of it the past few 天. You bring him Young Anselm's skull and tell him to sit with his thoughts, and to reflect on the Oaths. The man nods, and just a few minutes later he comes to you, skull in hand.%SPEECH_ON%You were right, captain. I had strayed from the path, but through the First Oathtaker's guidance I have found it again.%SPEECH_OFF% | Young Anselm's skull is starting to look a little ragged. Pieces of grass, mud, couple of bugs, all these things are smattered onto the bone. %oathtaker% comes up asking some inane question about inventory. You cut him off and hand him the skull and tell him to clean it. He nods, staring at the skull as though it were a pound of pure gold. He finishes the job within ten minutes, and when he gets back his disposition is entirely fresh, himself admitting that time alone with Young Anselm invigorated him, and reminded him why he took to the Oathtakers in the first place. That's all well and good, but the priority here is that he's also forgotten to talk to you about inventory which is fantastic.}"

Remember, I'm the one who pulled it out!%SPEECH_OFF%The kids fight each other for a time, but eventually a small girl takes the weapon and hurls it out of the tree fort's window. Its blade stakes into the ground, the steel warbling as it bends back and forth. She scoffs.%SPEECH_ON%Maybe it's for the best that someone else takes this thing, all they do is fight over it!%SPEECH_OFF%You wrap your hand around the sword's handle and its steel song hums to a quiet end. You unsheathe it from the earth and thank the kids for their contribution to the quest of the Oathtakers. The kids glance around at each other. One asks another.%SPEECH_ON%Do we have some sorta purpose now?%SPEECH_OFF%}"

Morale is low, the treasury is low, but even if you had the monies it seems like many might not even wish to join the company anyway given its lousy performance. Just then, a sellsword enters your camp with three men in tow. The man in front introduces himself, then makes his case.%SPEECH_ON%We knew of the %companyname% for its reputation, and we marched far to see it for ourselves. Now, if I may speak honestly, y'all seem beat to hell and not at all like the stories spoke of, but, shite, we know this world is hard on people and the only thing to do is make hay of it. We didn't walk all this way to get upset at a little scuff, y'know?%SPEECH_OFF%The men offer their services without upfront hiring costs, and not only this but the rest of the company is emboldened by the fact that the world still thinks highly of them and their efforts.
