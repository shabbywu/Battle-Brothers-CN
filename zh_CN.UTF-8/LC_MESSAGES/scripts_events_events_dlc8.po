"{[img]gfx/ui/events/event_05.png[/img]{%anatomist% is sitting near to the campfire. Almost too close. You pull him back a ways so he doesn't burn himself. He looks up, his face dotted with pustules and slathered in the grease of ones which have already popped.%SPEECH_ON%I'm beginning to wonder if I made a great mistake in drinking that potion.%SPEECH_OFF%He scoots back toward the flames, and there's a sense in his eyes that he wants to pitch himself into it. You can't do much for him, mostly because he looks awfully gross at the moment and you'd rather not touch him again. | You find %anatomist% standing beside the company wagon with a sleeve unfurled and his finger picking at some strange markings there. Curious, you ask if they are birthmarks. The anatomist turns, shaking his head. He lifts up his shirt to show that these markings are all over his body, mottling the flesh with unsightly colors which look rough to the touch, like scabs that cannot be peeled.%SPEECH_ON%The potion I drank did this and I know not what to with myself.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and tell him it'll surely get better. He sighs and simply lowers his shirt and looks away. | %anatomist% stands over a bucket of water, looking at his darkened reflection in it. He sighs. You ask how he is doing, and he turns to reveal horrific rashes and boils upon his skin.%SPEECH_ON%I am not doing so well, to be honest. The concoction I imbibed seems to have had a gravely ill-effect on me, though I am being perhaps a little giving with my vocabulary there. I will survive, but it has wounded me in ways that are not just of the skin and the body, but of the mind. I thought myself distanced from such matters, but now, seeing my horrible face...I am in a state of perpetual unease.%SPEECH_OFF%You grab his shoulder and give it a squeeze, then pat him on the back and make some recommendations like he should drink some water and of course to not feel bad. You weren't ever that great at consoling other men, much less ones suffering from terrible maladies sprung from scientific madness. | %anatomist% the anatomist is in a despondent state. The potion he made, and was in such a hurry to drink, has resulted in his entire body being overcome with maladies ranging from rashes to boils to what appear to be unusual spasms and plenty of snot from the nose. You assure him that he will get better, but his horrific appearance is taking a toll on him. | The strange concoctions %anatomist% the anatomist has been making, are strange concoctions that he has also been drinking. Unsurprisingly, the effects have not been good: rashes, infections, smells, hair falling out, and more. While on the outside he proclaims that what he is doing is in the name of science, you can tell that all these maladies and disfigurations are debilitating to the man's morale. You can only hope he gets better with time. | Matters of science, which are far outside your understanding, always do seem to come with risks. You remember as a child that your friend took the risk of swinging out on a rope into a river, and by happenstance you all found out just how much weight a branch can hold while in the throes of Fall.\n"
"\n"
"Now, it seems %anatomist% the anatomist is finding out the debilitating nature of drinking one of his bizarre potions. He is overwhelmed with rashes and infections, and for some reason he is a siren to ants, who for who knows what reason now love to crawl on him at all hours of day and night. Hopefully, with time, these maladies will depart, and hopefully take the damned ants with them. | You always knew the anatomists to be a bit wrong in the head, but the way they've been creating potions and drinking them has really floored you. Water alone can be poisonous if sipped from the wrong cup, nevermind wholesale concoctions which are distilled in the mire of whatever scientific notions the anatomists are carrying that day. Naturally, it isn't long until one of the eggheads, %anatomist%, falls ill. He is still capable of moving and day-to-day tasks, but the giant warts and leaking pustules makes him a horror to look at, and though he may see himself distanced from society, you've little doubt that walking around looking like a rag that's mopped up pigshite is healthy for the mind and spirit. Hopefully, with a bit of time, he might get better. | %anatomist% isn't necessarily sick from drinking his potions. After all, he is still able to move and get around, and even fight if necessary. But he is certainly affected by said potions in a manner most unsightly. Great boils have appeared on his cheeks, and occasionally his eyes spring from their sockets and he has to push them back in which is something you wished you hadn't seen. Strings of drool come down the corners of his lips and his nostril is home to snails of snot and boogers and blood. As you can imagine, he is rather down about the whole looking uglier than a dead pig carcass-thing, but you've faith that in good time he will get better.}"
msgstr "{[img]gfx/ui/events/event_05.png[/img]{%anatomist%正坐在篝火边，离火堆太近了几乎要烧到自己。你把他拉远一点，他抬起头，满脸都是痘痘，脸上还沾满了那些已经破溃了的油脂。%SPEECH_ON%我开始怀疑自己喝下那剂药水是不是一个巨大的错误。%SPEECH_OFF%他向火堆挪动，目光中有一种想要跳入火中的感觉。你对他的情况无能为力，大概是因为他现在看起来相当恶心，你不想再碰他了。|你在战团的车旁找到%anatomist%，他的袖子已经卷起，他的手指在挑弄一些奇怪的标记。你很好奇，问他是不是先天母斑。解剖学家转过身来，摇头道。他解开上衣，示意身上有了很多这样的印记，肌肉上还斑驳着丑陋的彩色斑点，看上去会有一种不平滑、像是别人剥不下来的疮。%SPEECH_ON%我喝下的那剂药水导致了这些变化，我不知道该怎么办了。%SPEECH_OFF%你点头安慰他，告诉他这些很快会好起来。他叹了口气，简单地放下上衣，不想再看向你。|%anatomist%正在看着他倒映在桶中的黑暗影子。他叹了口气。你问他最近怎么样，他转过身来，露出了皮肤上的恶心的皮疹和脓泡。%SPEECH_ON%说实话，我状态不太好。我饮用的混合物好像对我产生了严重的影响，虽然我这里的表述可能有些夸张。我会活下去的，但这伤害并不仅限于身体，实际上也会影响我的状态。我认为自己保持距离，但现在我看到自己那令人恶心的脸……我一直处在一种不安的状态中。%SPEECH_OFF%你握住他的肩膀，轻轻拍了拍他的背，安慰他并给了他一些建议，比如喝水，当然也让他不要太过担心。你并不擅长安慰别人，更何况是遭受科学疯狂带来的可怕疾病的人。|%anatomist%解剖学家正在沮丧中。他调制的药水，自己急于饮用后，导致他全身被疹和溃疡覆盖。你确信他会好起来，但他恶心的外表太过折磨他了。|%anatomist%制作的奇怪混合物自己也喝了，结果当然不太好：疹子、感染、异味、掉头发等。虽然他坚持认为自己这么做是为了科学，但你们都知道这些疾病和畸形对他的士气产生了严峻的负面影响。希望他能随着时间的推移好起来。|你始终认为解剖学家头脑有些糊涂，但他一边制作奇怪的药水，一边喝下去，实在让你措手不及。即使是从错误的杯子里小口地喝一口水，也可能导致中毒，更不用说像解剖学家们今天研究的那种全面混合物。自然而然，其中一个脑袋，%anatomist%，很快就生病了。他还能动，能进行日常活动，但如此巨大的赘瘤和渗出的脓水毁了他的外观。虽然他对自己与社会的关系保持着一定的距离，但你毫不怀疑散步时看上去像一张拖过猪排的废布对他的身心健康有害。希望他会随着时间的推移好转。|%anatomist%并不是通过饮用药水生病的。毕竟，他还能动，而且即使需要，他也能战斗。但他的皮肤受到了药水的影响，看上去非常丑陋。他的脸上长出了大疣，有时他的眼睛甚至从眼眶中跑出来，需要将其推回去，这是你不想看到的。他的口角下流着口水，鼻孔里爬着蜗牛的鼻涕、鼻屎和血液。你可以想象，他的外貌比死了一只猪的尸体还难看，但你相信他最终一定会好起来。}"

Yet, some of my peers have found bones of creatures that have not once been seen in the flesh. It appears that these entities have disappeared entirely. It begs the question: does such evidence entail that we, ourselves, will one day disappear?

The anatomist opens the red book and shows you a drawing.%SPEECH_ON%They are quite similar to humans, but larger with implied bulkiness around the neck and shoulders.

He sees these horrific scars and ever growing pustules as evidence that he is on the right path. In some way, he is right. These strange changes have made him a far superior fighter than he was before, which is saying a lot for you personally had no hope that these foolish eggheads ever had a shot of becoming even competent fighters at best. Whatever fears and worries he had prior are now gone entirely, replaced by a renewed sense of purpose and desire to do more. | %anatomist% has stopped moping around worrying about his scars and horrible appearance. It seems he has made peace with how he looks now, or possibly he has simply become so ingratiated with the godawful smell emanating from every part of him that he no longer notices. While his stink brings you to nearly vomit every time you're near him, at the very least he has recovered from the dourness which was occupying his every waking minute. Maybe now he can continue on his righteous path to scientific discovery, or however else he put it. | It is hard to come to terms with who you are and, despite the superficiality, it is even more difficult to make peace with how you look. This is even more true when how you look was not the manner in which you were born, but shaped by the actions you took in life. If your own decisions brought you to this newfound state, you have only your own choices to dwell upon for the rest of your life. You've seen it many a time, particularly with sellswords who lose their ears, noses, lips, and worse. It can take a long time for a man to come to peace with his newformed circumstances, and %anatomist% was no different. But come to peace he has. Whatever horrific scars and mutations he has suffered from his own actions are no more - at least mentally. He has moved on and is ready to continue his path in this world as someone seeking scientific endeavors, and the great risks to himself that those endeavors might one day pose. | %anatomist% has come to terms with his new appearances. At first, his body's reactions to the potions and concoctions he's been imbibing were so disturbing that he reeled into a shell of his former self. You could hardly blame him, for he did and does look quite hideous. But after a while, you simply realize that life goes on, and if nothing can be done about it then nothing can be done about it. And, at the very least, the real purpose of the choices made were to satisfy scientific inquiries, and it seems re-realizing that has revivified %anatomist%'s sense of purpose. He is still ungainly and disgusting and you have a hard time looking at him, but least he's happier now. | Once wounded by maladies and disfigurements, %anatomist% the anatomist is starting to look a lot better now. That is to say, he has come to realize that there is little he can do about his physical appearance which is, to be terse, still something that takes courage and willpower to just look at. But the man has remembered the true reason he sought the concoctions and strange mixtures and tinctures which have turned him into a walking and talking monstrosity, and that reason is a matter of scientific endeavor. The anatomist is now a happier man and as long as he can be kept far away from even the smallest of mirrors you imagine that can more or less remain the case. | %anatomist%'s habit of sucking down any every potion he concocts did eventually come to bite him in the ass. His last imbibement when horribly wrong, turning his face into fleshy dough, and arising across his skin all manner of bumps and bruises and pustules and pusses. Naturally, these changes had a deep morale impact on the man. But, finally, he has gotten over it. He is still a walking, talking monstrosity in every sense of the word, but on the inside he is at peace with it, and what's on the inside is what counts. Or at least it better count, because what's on the outside you can barely muster the courage to look at. | %anatomist% the anatomist calls the changes to his body 'mutations', which must be some sort of egghead word for looking like shite. For a while, his appearance was a drag on his day to day life. You can hardly blame him, he inflicted these maladies upon himself which is always far worse than when the world does it to you and leaves little doubt as to how you could have unfarked yourself. Thankfully, the anatomist has gotten over his depression and angst about his horrendous appearance. He might even be more willing than ever to keep imbibing his potions and concoctions. Surely he can't look much worse than he already does and at a certain point of looking completely hideous even the ladyfolk take a turn, like seeing a dog so mangy and decrepit that one can't help but pet it out of curiosity. | After he drank a number of questionable potions, %anatomist% the anatomist's body began to change and, like any grown man, change at that age is rarely a good thing. His face became disfigured, his body mottled with sores and scars. For a time, the anatomist fell into a deep depression over the matter and you wondered if he had been irreversibly damaged not just on the outside, but the inside as well. Thankfully, it is the morale of a man that can be the hardest to break. %anatomist% has come to terms with his new appearance. It's not as though there is much he can do about it, and he now sees it as a sort of fundamental rite by fire that he is the way he is, and that he has helped pursue the scientific endeavors which brought him to these lands in the first place.

The anatomist writes a few pages down in his notes.%SPEECH_ON%The other day I watched a spider jump twenty-times its body length to snatch a fly. And this spider I've let go would, upon seeing its prey, speed across the ground like a hunting dog. It seems that the old gods have taken pity on us, scapegrace, for neither of these creatures can be found in their larger, webknecht forms.%SPEECH_OFF%While being tackled and ripped apart would be quite terrible, you tell him that being wrapped in a cocoon before having your blood sucked out by fangs is undoubtedly worse. The anatomist raises a finger.%SPEECH_ON%A common misconception, scapegrace, for the webknecht actually prefers to feed long after you are deceased. We believe its toxins are designed to target the belly, opening it up and using its fluids to melt you from the inside out. This is presumably why they hang their prey upside down, so the toxins can slosh over the organs, turning you into a sort of sack of fluids. The consuming phase of the process is merely one of digesting whatever is left. The only time they don't eat you is if they're placing their brood inside you as the spiderlings will need sustenance upon hatching.%SPEECH_OFF%That still sounds infinitely worse than being shanked by a hunting spider, but either way you regret having the conversation and pursue it no further.

The surrounded man is wearing a black hat and has a crossbow at his side and a finger on the trigger. Nearby stands a pyre with a post in the middle, and tethers missing someone to shackle. The crowd shouts and hollers and through their spit and froth you piece together what had occurred: the town hired a witch hunter and, as one belligerent peasant explains, the hunter found the witch and decided she wasn't a witch at all and let her go. The peasant stumbles around almost crying.%SPEECH_ON%And that ain't right, it just ain't right. We built this pyre and everythin' to see the fires have her. It just ain't right, but we'll make it right. Because we sure as hells gonna burn something ain't that right!%SPEECH_OFF%The crowd roars.

"[img]gfx/ui/events/event_43.png[/img]{You step forward and explain the rules of an agreement, explaining that surely the village hired the man to kill a witch, and if the person they directed him toward was not a witch, then he cannot kill her. If he still went ahead and did so, then he'd be compelled to act on account of crowns. If he decided not to kill her, and the village rescinded its agreement, then he'd later be compelled to simply do the bidding of every village to prevent that situation from happening again. Through a series of gentle explanations you show that the village is in danger of displaying for all that it is untrustworthy, and that by the virtue of the example it sets it will only be set upon by charlatans and miscreants with aims on their gold and not on completing a task as asked. And, if anything, the hunter's refusal to burn an innocent shows the strength of his character.\n"
"\n"
"When you're finished, the crowd mostly agrees, but then someone says 'burn him anyway!' and everyone roars back into a rage. Turning around, though, they find the witch hunter slipped out while you were giving your spiel. The peasants start blaming one another for not keeping an eye on him. Arguments quickly descend into fighting and you make your leave. When you hit the edge of town, you run across the man of the hour. He thanks you with a count of crowns. You find it very unusual that a man would part with money when he could have simply left. He tips his black hat and says he doesn't do this witch hunting business for the money.}"
