He regards you with a steely gaze, a troop of sheep and dogs idling at his side.%SPEECH_ON%Mmm, don't suppose yer gearing up to fight for %noblehouse% are ya? I hear it and the other families of the realm are quarreling. Don't know what about. Just know they'll come by my place and ask, '%randomname%, why don'tchu come and fight for us, or else we hang ya', and I'll say 'okay', because a buncha gold-britches nobleman ruining my year is a part of life, and life just ain't fair.%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_91.png[/img]A woman in the road stands by the company's wayside as you march past.

She shrugs.%SPEECH_ON%Way I hears it, the pompy pissants be mad about a royal marriage gone awry. Lotta noise coming about how it means war or some such shite. They noblefolk always squabbling over something, only a matter of time 'til they cross swords with one another, or ask us poorfolk to do it for them.%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_17.png[/img]An old man sitting and smoking a pipe regards your company with a long, hazy stare.%SPEECH_ON%Mercenaries, eh? There will be a lotta good work for you in the coming days.%SPEECH_OFF%You ask what he means. He cleans the pipe, clattering it against his cheer.%SPEECH_ON%Ohh, you know.

He smiles.%SPEECH_ON%Figured as much. Now, sometimes the noblefolk call me up to give me papers to send out. Sometimes little ol' me eavesdrops on their conversations.

Hey!%SPEECH_OFF%You turn around to see a boy poking his head out of a bush. He smiles at you.%SPEECH_ON%Hey, I got something to say. There's a war a comin'.%SPEECH_OFF%Believing this snarky little runt isn't high on your to do list. You ask how he knows that. He smiles again.%SPEECH_ON%I fetch water for a man who wears silk britches. He said, 'I can give ye some sweets, or give ye something to think about.' I said tell me something good. He said, 'the nobility are gonna fight one another.' So that's what I'm telling ya.%SPEECH_OFF%The kid pauses.%SPEECH_ON%Say, ya wouldn't happen to have any sweets, would ya? Hey... hey!%SPEECH_OFF%You push the kid's head back into the bushes. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_75.png[/img]An old man and a fair-skinned maiden meets you on the road. She's twisting a braid of hair over a shoulder, glancing at a couple of your better looking men with plying eyes. Before you get a word out, she asks if you're going to fight for %noblehouse% or %noblehouse2%.%SPEECH_ON%They say a prince ran off with a princess, said it t'was a matter of love. Isn't that dreamy?%SPEECH_OFF%You shrug. The elderly man hocks and spits.%SPEECH_ON%Don't bother the sellswords with your fantasies, woman. Sorry, mercenary, she gets these ideas in her head and I don't know where from. The houses are talking of war, but it sure as shite ain't over a prancing prince or some punter of a princess. Economics! That's the issue. Long standing trade agreements are falling apart just like the paper they was written upon. Let me tell you, I was there when they...%SPEECH_OFF%The old fart dawdles on. You much preferred the lady's story, as ludicrous as it sounded. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_75.png[/img]You come across a man sitting atop a signpost. He's tightening strings on a lute and testing the sounds.%SPEECH_ON%Mmhmm, that was better, wouldn't you agree? Just agree.%SPEECH_OFF%Nodding, you ask the man what he is doing. He jumps off the signpost and lands arms and legs out like a jester at the end of his act.%SPEECH_ON%Practicing! War is comin', heard on the winds m'self, and with war comes a need for... for... for... c'mon, you can do it, entertainment! That's right! And in any call for nightly pleasures is a call for me - and in more ways than one, let me tell ya.%SPEECH_OFF%He pirouettes and grins. You've never seen a man with a whiter smile and you have a strong urge to blacken it dearly. The minstrel prances down the path.%SPEECH_ON%Don't you worry, sellsword, with the nobles fighting amongst themselves there shall never be a shortage of work for men of your, er, talents. G'day!%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_16.png[/img]More and more, you're coming across peasants and merchants murmuring about a war between the noble houses. Your station as a sellsword has them asking you which side you are planning to carry your banner for. If these rumors are true, then the %companyname% stands to make a great deal of coin out of the misery wrought between pompous highborn. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_45.png[/img]You come across a number of gamblers on the road. They've positioned little flags representing all the noble families of the land. The bookie is writing down notes and looks over his scroll.%SPEECH_ON%Now remember, the results of this war between houses isn't going to be obvious for some time. Hell, I most of ye will be conscripted. But all who survive shall return to me in one year's time. From there, we will pay out the monies to those who bet on the winning noble house. Deal?%SPEECH_OFF%Crooked faced and slackjawed peasants shrug.%SPEECH_ON%Sounds like a deal to me!%SPEECH_OFF%The bookie grins, a golden incisor glinting ever so slightly.%SPEECH_ON%Great!%SPEECH_OFF%He takes the bets in a satchel and loads up for the road, most likely to never return again. Truly a shame what sorta nonsense the lowborn get themselves into. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_75.png[/img]During your travels, you keep hearing a particularly interesting rumor: that the noble houses are positioning for war. If true, the %companyname% could stand to make a lot of coin, particularly if it chooses a winning side. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_23.png[/img]Peasant after peasant is telling the same story lately. In fact, they seem to be repeating it every time you meet them...\n"
"\n"
" War. War is on their lips. The noble houses are squabbling over something you could care less about, but what it means is war, and war means crowns for a sellsword, and crowns are good, so war is good. Should these rumors be true, the %companyname% should measure its options carefully and choose a noblehouse to support in the conflict to come. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_80.png[/img]You've noticed recruiters for the noble houses are afoot, pulling young, fresh men out of their homes. Conscription isn't unordinary, but typically you still need the fellas to farm the fields. If the highborn are leaving that to the womenfolk, then it means something else is of greater import, and that something else is undoubtedly a brewing war. The %companyname% should prepare itself for the worst - well, the worst for everyone else. A war between rich arseholes is the greatest time to be a sellsword!}"

What isn't fire, is blackened by its passing, what isn't dead, is screaming as the flames eat their flesh.

" The company stays alert for a time, but nothing else comes.

I sure as hell hope not.%SPEECH_OFF%It would be a disaster if they were, but for now you'll just sit happy in the idea that all the evidence here is merely coincidental. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]You look at your map then look at the scene before you.%SPEECH_ON%A hamlet was supposed to be here.%SPEECH_OFF%%randombrother% walks past, chowing down on an apple with a satisfying crunch.%SPEECH_ON%Mmhmm, might wanna pen in some edits then, sir.%SPEECH_OFF%The village is nothing but ash. Its inhabitants are hanging from wooden posts or any tree still standing. Bones of those not hanged are piled in the middle of what was probably the town square.

Goblins, orcs. %randombrother% shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%Surely they are not working together, right?%SPEECH_OFF%You shrug and answer.%SPEECH_ON%I'm sure the orcs swept through and then the goblins came and picked the remains, or possibly the other way around.%SPEECH_OFF%The sellsword nods, assured by your explanation though you both know deep down that the collection of tracks are most likely not a coincidence. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_97.png[/img]You come across a kid squatting beside a creekbed.

Both the hands appear to be missing. He stares up at you and the momentum carries him backward, the poor man falling flat and staring up at the skies, pawing at it with nubby forearms.%SPEECH_ON%They're working together. Killed... Killed everyone. I couldn't believe the sight of it. I always said if they came, I'd be prepared, for one or the other. But there they were. Together.%SPEECH_OFF%You ask who or what he's talking about. The man's chest seizes up, pain crookedly crawls across his face, and he takes his last breath. A reflected sky arcs in the glisten of his opened eyes, all to see in death's blindness. %randombrother% checks the body, but there's nothing to take. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_95.png[/img]A totem of skulls, leathered skins flapping off the segments, each head wearing a cape quite gruesomely of their own making. Blood speckles and fills the ground. More bones. Muscles and tendons, things unused or uneaten. Scorched earth where a campfire grew and scattered ash where it died. %randombrother% picks around the scene, looking for clues. He holds up the shaft of a crude weapon, and a couple of darts found in a goatskin bag.%SPEECH_ON%This is too big for a man's hand, and these are clearly gobbo arrows tipped with, hmm, yes, poison. Greenskins no doubt came through here and they did so working together.%SPEECH_OFF%Working together? That's a horrible thought, but it does appear to be true. Are the savage tribes up to something? | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_71.png[/img]You come to the burnt remains of a hovel. There are skeletons about the rubble, bones jagged and clambering in what was final, painful desperations. A lock lays in a pile of ash beside what should have been the door, suggesting the people held up inside, while the outsiders simply burned the place down.%SPEECH_ON%Sir, you should see this.%SPEECH_OFF%%randombrother% beckons you over. He's standing before a tree. There's a dead goblin leaning against the trunk, palms out, empty, an ugly look on its face, and a pitchfork in its chest. A dead orc is beside it with a shovelhead sticking out of its skull. %randombrother% wonders if they killed each other. You hope so, but their mortal wounds look a lot like a human's doing, and if it were a human's doing, it's possible these greenskins were working together. The thought frightens you deeply. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_59.png[/img]Refugees on the road, a stream of them, women with babes swaddled and roped behind their backs and affront their bellies, men with pitchforks for walking sticks, discalced friars cutting religious rites through the air with their fingers and breathing prayers under their breath. You try and talk, but they shrink from you, wide-eyed. Finally, an elderly speaks to you quietly.%SPEECH_ON%Don't try, sir, they've seen too much. The greenskins... they came in the night. Orcs in the village, goblins outside it waiting to ambush all that ran. The militia was massacred. Only us cowardly folk survived, and even then only the fastest among us.%SPEECH_OFF%You ask the man if he just said goblins and orcs were working together. He nods and pats you on the shoulder.%SPEECH_ON%Aye, I did. Safe travels, stranger.%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_76.png[/img]A man dressed for pomp and pleasure is standing beside the road. He's staring ahead, his hands out to his side, perhaps to balance out a little too much drink in the system. You grab and wheel the man around. His face rocks forward, eye sockets emptied, tendrils of his sight hanging down to his cheeks like rotten crawfish. Two handless arms slap your shoulders as he tries to grip you. His face contorts into a guttural scream that reflects the barbarities he's come to experience.\n"

The man screams.%SPEECH_ON%Orcs! Goblins! Orcs! Goblins! Orcs! Gob... goblins...%SPEECH_OFF%His breath leaves him. He's dead, thank the old gods. Is there something to make of his final words?}"

" 战队 保持了一段时间的警惕，但没有其他的事情发生。 大家一致认为这一定是绿皮干的，尽管似乎有证据表明兽人和哥布林都在这里活动… | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_97.png[/img]一个小伙子带着他的狗小跑着经过。 他停在人群前，拍了拍他的小杂种狗的头。%SPEECH_ON%你们是追杀绿皮的士兵？ 据我所知，那些大个子的很难被杀死，而矮个子的是一种很狡猾的生物。%SPEECH_OFF%你问那个人他来自哪里。他耸耸肩。%SPEECH_ON%离这里很远很远的地方。 我是一个流浪者，先生们，我和我的狗。 但是我在旅行中看到了很多。%SPEECH_OFF%%randomname% 冲了过来。%SPEECH_ON%你看到兽人和哥布林合作了？%SPEECH_OFF%这个男孩点头。%SPEECH_ON%是的！他们为什么不呢？ 嘿，好吧，你们不是我想象中的那种人。 祝你们地久天长，好梦不断。%SPEECH_OFF%他走过一些矗立的灌木丛。 你追过去，但当你追到另一边时，男孩和狗都不见了。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_94.png[/img]你先听到了苍蝇的叫声，然后才看到它们所制造的混乱。 一个小茅屋，简单的木制构架，一个漂亮的茅草屋顶，一些挂在绳子上的罐子，一个在风中旋转的风铃，给空气带来欢乐的木制编钟，草地上有三具残缺不全的尸体，一堆虫子在尸体上成群结队。%randombrother% 蹲在一具尸体前面，戳着血里突出的骨头。%SPEECH_ON%一定是兽人干的。那里的脚步声可能就是。%SPEECH_OFF%你点了点头，但注意到小屋的门上粘着几条飞镖。 你摘了一个，然后闻一闻。%SPEECH_ON%毒药。不仅仅是兽人在这里。%SPEECH_OFF%%randombrother% 嗅了嗅其中一个飞镖，点了点头。%SPEECH_ON%是，兽人和哥布林。 一起合作吗？我当然不希望这样。%SPEECH_OFF%如果它们是，那将是一场灾难，但现在你只能高兴地坐着，认为所有的证据都只是巧合。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]你先看地图，然后再看眼前的景色。%SPEECH_ON%这里应该有一个小村庄。%SPEECH_OFF%%randombrother% 走过时，嘴里嚼着一个苹果，发出令人满意的嘎吱嘎吱的声音。%SPEECH_ON%嗯哼，也许要来只笔来记述一下，先生。%SPEECH_OFF%这个村庄成了一片废墟。 它的居民被挂在木桩上或任何仍然挺立的树上。 那些没有被绞死的人的尸骨堆在可能是城镇广场的中央。 盯着地面，你看到了从大屠杀中延伸出来的脚印。 小的，大的。 哥布林，兽人。%randombrother% 摇了摇头。%SPEECH_ON%他们肯定没有在合作，对吧？%SPEECH_OFF%你耸耸肩答道。%SPEECH_ON%我敢肯定兽人横扫而过，然后哥布林来了，捡起了遗骨，或者可能是反过来的。%SPEECH_OFF%佣兵点了点头，你的解释让他确信你们俩都知道这两件事很可能不是巧合。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_97.png[/img]你看到一个孩子蹲在河床上。 他正在用一根棍子在泥里画人物－小棍子一样的人，旁边有带角的大头盔和小帽子，即使是小棍一样的人也全副武装。%randombrother% 问孩子到底在做什么。%SPEECH_ON%画绿皮。我经常看见他们，他们在山上乱窜乱撞，我爸说就像敞开着门的食品间里进了老鼠。%SPEECH_OFF%你问他住哪儿。 他指了指附近山上树木繁茂的山坡。%SPEECH_ON%那边。可以很好地看到不少事情。 也希望你们去瞅瞅。%SPEECH_OFF%一位老人大声喊着孩子的名字，他答应了，放下了他的复古艺术工具，朝小山走去。%SPEECH_ON%我正在创作。你们玩得开心！ 不要踩到我的画！%SPEECH_OFF%现在你意识到简笔画是兽人和哥布林，但也许孩子只是在幻想。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_36.png[/img]你在路边发现一个小伙子，他把胳膊抱在胸前。 两只手好像不见了。 他抬头望着你，可能是你的气场让他向后倒去，这个可怜的人直挺挺地倒在地上，抬头望着天空，胖乎乎的前臂胡乱挥舞着。%SPEECH_ON%他们合作了。杀了…杀了每个人。 我不敢相信所看到的。 我总是说，如果他们来了，我会做好准备，其中一种或另一种。 但是现在他们是。合作了。%SPEECH_OFF%你问他在说谁或什么。 那人的胸脯紧绷着，痛苦歪歪扭扭地爬过他的脸，他咽下了最后一口气。 在他睁开的眼睛里，反射出一道弧形的光，这一切都是为了在死前最后看看这个世界。%randombrother% 搜查了他的尸体，但没有东西可以带走。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_95.png[/img]一个头骨图腾，皮质的皮肤从碎片上剥落下来，每个头都披着一件他们自己制作的可怕的斗篷。 鲜血染红了大地。 更多的骨头。肌肉和肌腱，未使用或未食用的东西。 营火造成的焦土，熄灭的灰烬。%randombrother% 在现场寻找线索。 他举起一件简陋武器的枪杆，在一个山羊皮包里找到了两支飞镖。%SPEECH_ON%这对一个人的手来说太大了，而这些显然是带有毒药的哥布林箭。 毫无疑问，绿皮来到这里，他们一起工作。%SPEECH_OFF%一起工作？那是一个可怕的想法，但似乎是真的。这些野蛮部落接下来会做什么呢？ | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_71.png[/img]你来到一间茅屋的废墟。 瓦砾堆上到处是骷髅，骨头参差不齐，在这最后的痛苦和绝望之地滚动。 一把锁放在本该是门的旁边的一堆灰烬里，暗示着里面的人被挡住了，而外面的人只是把这个地方烧了。%SPEECH_ON%先生，你应该看看这个。%SPEECH_OFF%%randombrother% 招手唤你过来。 他站在一棵树前。 有一个死去的哥布林倚在树干上，两手摊开，空空的，脸上一副丑陋的表情，胸前插着一把干草叉。 一个死去的兽人站在它旁边，脑袋上插着一个铲子头。%randombrother% 不知道他们是否互相残杀。 你希望如此，但是他们致命的伤口看起来很像人类的行为，如果这是人类的行为，那么这些绿皮可能在一起工作。 这个想法让深深恐惧的想法。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_59.png[/img]难民们在路上，一群一群的难民，妇女们用襁褓裹着婴儿，用绳子绑在背后，磨破了她们的肚皮，男人们用干草叉当拐杖，剃光了胡须的修士们用手指在空中比划宗教仪式，低声祈祷。 你试着和他们交谈，但他们却睁大眼睛躲避你。 最后，一位老人轻声对你说话。%SPEECH_ON%不要去尝试了，先生，他们看起来太多了。 绿皮…他们昨晚来了。 兽人在村子里，哥布林在村子外面等着伏击一切逃跑的人。 民兵遭到屠杀。 只有我们这些胆小的人才能活下来，即使这样，也只有我们当中跑得最快的人才能活下来。%SPEECH_OFF%你问他是不是说哥布林和兽人在一起工作了。 他点头，拍拍你的肩膀。%SPEECH_ON%啊，我确定。旅途平安，陌生人。%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_76.png[/img]路边站着一个打扮得漂漂亮亮的人。 他眼睛盯着前方，双手向两侧伸出，也许是为了平衡体内过量的酒精。 你抓住那个人，把他推来推去。 他的脸向前晃动，眼神空洞，眉毛的卷须像腐烂的小龙虾一样垂到脸颊上。 当他试图抓住你时，两只没有手的手臂拍着你的肩膀。 他的脸扭曲着用喉咙发声，反映出他所经历的野蛮。\n"

" %randombrother% 迅速采取行动，砍倒了这个人。 陌生人向后倒去，他的貂皮大衣敞开着，露出一具被残忍虐待的裸体，现在你意识到，你宁愿看到一个男人身体的某部分，也不愿看到他们消失。 他受到的残害使他毁灭，那些刀痕和切口撑开了他的肉，就像破解谜题一样。 他的器官从缝隙中钻了出来，在紫色的绳索和包里舒展开来。这个人尖叫着。%SPEECH_ON%兽人！哥布林！兽人！哥布林！兽人！哥布…哥布林…%SPEECH_OFF%他的呼吸停止了。 谢天谢地，他已经死了。 他最后说的话有什么意义吗？}"

"{[img]gfx/ui/events/event_17.png[/img]While stopping for a brief respite, a stranger approaches the camp. He's got a wooden stake for a leg, though he wobbles on it with practiced efficiency. Hobbling to you, he tips a cap of broomstraw.%SPEECH_ON%I suppose you fellas are here for the happenings?%SPEECH_OFF%You glance at %randombrother% then back to the man. He shrugs.%SPEECH_ON%Ah, mayhaps ye don't know. I don't really know, either, but there be a lot of grisly stories about what is happening all around these parts. The way I hear it, the dead are walking the earth, but that's hogwash. I think it's just a bunch of brigands with new tricks up their sleeves. Anyway, be seeing you. Stay safe and all that malarkey.%SPEECH_OFF%The man laughs as he stilts away. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_97.png[/img]A child is found beside the path with a skull laid between their legs. Its upside down with insects battling one another in the bowl of the brainpan. The kid briefly looks up.%SPEECH_ON%Hi there.%SPEECH_OFF%You ask where his parents are. He picks up a dead bug from the skull, looks at it, then tosses it over his shoulder. He puts another wriggling gladiator into the grey arena then stares at you.%SPEECH_ON%Parents? Why they ain't been around for awhile. Father went to his parents, and mother to hers. And they both was ate'n.%SPEECH_OFF%You raise an eyebrow and ask for him to repeat what he just said, but the kid ignores you, absentmindedly cheering into the hollow head as his bugs do battle. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_18.png[/img]You come to a man standing in the path. He's got a shovel yoked over both shoulders, his hands crucifixed across each side, and he's dripping with mud. He glances up, this golem of earth, and asks where you're going. Before you answer, he interrupts.%SPEECH_ON%Don't go that way. Don't go no way. They're everywhere. I was digging, you see? Digging to get to them first. But they know. They where we are. Don't go nowhere, because they're everywhere. Don't go nowhere, because they're everywhere, and they know... they know, don't you see?%SPEECH_OFF%He presses his head forward, his cringing face crooning forth from his dripping arms like some muddied bat come to feast on your dreams. You ease past the man. %randombrother% looks him up and down, shrugs, and follows you. The %companyname% has no time for such madmen. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_71.png[/img]While on the road, you come to a small, empty hut. %randombrother% snoops around inside, you beside him, the both of you with blades out. He shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%Ain't shit here.%SPEECH_OFF%He looks up and points.%SPEECH_ON%Except there.%SPEECH_OFF%You look up and see that the ceiling is covered in blood. Not just covered... written over. Unfortunately, the script is hard to read as the crimson words are muddied by mold and termitic erasure.\n"

" Clearly the work of a madman. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_46.png[/img]There's a copse in the path, a little set of trees that stand tall in an otherwise flat clearing. You take some respite there, for little trees such as these borrow the silence and sereneness from their larger forest cousins. Except not this one. This one you find a dead child in the bushes.\n"
"\n"
" %randombrother% comes up and covers his mouth.%SPEECH_ON%By the might of the old gods, who would do such a thing?%SPEECH_OFF%You take a knee. There are tracks all over the area. It appears the kid was chased and ended up running into the bushes. Probably got tied up there, stuck. More footsteps followed. Way more. They stayed for a while, then left with bloody footprints. The kid, what is left of him, is covered in bite marks. You turn to the mercenary and answer.%SPEECH_ON%I think it's a matter of what, not who. But they're gone. Somewhere yonder, a few days ahead I'd wager, but...%SPEECH_OFF%You count the footsteps, but they prove too many.%SPEECH_ON%I think whatever did this... we'll be seeing it soon.%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_76.png[/img]You come to a man standing with a white banner, an unthreaded sigil in the middle, its frayed remains billowing in the wind.

He looks incredulous.%SPEECH_ON%You know, flesh. As opposed to bones. I've seen too many of those lately so, yeah, it's nice seeing some flesh.%SPEECH_OFF%You inquire further, asking what kind of bones this man has been seeing. He slims his eyes as if guarding them against the winds of a past he'd prefer to forget.%SPEECH_ON%The walkin' kind. Bones that'll walk through your door in the middle of the night. Bones that kill everything in front of them. Bones that want to see more bones just like them. Them sort of bones, got it?%SPEECH_OFF%His face lightens up, the eyes widening. He pivots toward you and suddenly leans forward.%SPEECH_ON%You wouldn't happen to be made of bones, would you?%SPEECH_OFF%Sensing a threat in the words, %randombrother% jumps in, positioning to kill the man before he can act. You settle everyone down. The stranger appears at ease, but you order the %companyname% to walk around him with care. He doesn't move. He simply stands as the last tendrils of his banner unravel into the wind. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_40.png[/img]There's a man in the path. He's on his hands and knees with scrolls littered all around. He bounds from one to the other like a dog would a scattering of treats. He shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%No no no, no! Where is it? Ah! Stranger! I mean, uh, sellsword, er, friend! Friend?%SPEECH_OFF%You ask what the man is doing. His hands are shaking as he answers.%SPEECH_ON%I, uh, have a theory. About who we are, er, were. In the past. Way before today, understand? Of course you do.%SPEECH_OFF%You watch as the man gathers his notes, stuffing them into a satchel. He continues.%SPEECH_ON%I think our past is coming to haunt us again, my dear sir sellsword friend, and when they come, they will kill us all. Because they want it back. They want it ALL back.%SPEECH_OFF%The man throws the satchel over his shoulder and nods.%SPEECH_ON%Now I have others to inform. Thanks for listening and, uh, farewell.%SPEECH_OFF%Well... bye. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_75.png[/img]While marching, something crunches awkwardly underfoot. You stop and take a knee to see. Swiping away some dirt, you find splintered shards of pottery. They appear to be, or used to be, part of a piece of art. You piece them together until a picture comes into view. %randombrother% stands behind you and asks.%SPEECH_ON%So, what is that?%SPEECH_OFF%You trace a finger along the artwork. Depicted are armored soldiers with spears and behind them more men stand with polearms, their formation as thick as the forests from which they made their weapons. They appear to be marching forward one step at a time, cutting down all the enemies in their path with brutal efficiency.\n"

" You try and pick the shards up. A low hum emits from the clay and each piece suddenly turns to powder, the remains streaming between your fingers. Something that old... that peculiar... what is it doing out here in the middle of nowhere? | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_11.png[/img]An odd figure shuffles across the path. You draw your sword and follow, eventually creeping behind a small girl holding an infant. The child wheels around to look at you, the bundled babe in her arms comfortably asleep. You ask what they are doing way out here. The girl shrugs.%SPEECH_ON%Running from the bads.%SPEECH_OFF%You cautiously glance around before asking what she means. She responds as if the answer to the question is tiresomely obvious.%SPEECH_ON%The bads. We buried them good, but they came up bad. Now they're killing everyone. So I run. I run from the bads.%SPEECH_OFF%She peers down at the infant and then out toward the land.%SPEECH_ON%Excuse me, sir. My grandfather lives yonder. He is expecting me and me alone.%SPEECH_OFF%You grab her shoulder and ask where her parents are. She shrugs off your hand.%SPEECH_ON%They're with the bads. Now excuse me, I must get going.%SPEECH_OFF%Clutching the baby, the girl quickly ducks into some brush. Such a little thing, she hardly makes a noise thereafter, and you've little doubt that her safe silence will see her to her destination. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_91.png[/img]You come to an old woman in the road. She waves you down with one hand while the other clutches her neck. As you get closer, you see that her white hairs are waning, leaving a dome of her skull revealed, and her garish nose wheeze with every breath. Age has been most unkind in all resorts. Her words are expectedly labored.%SPEECH_ON%Have you seen an old man on the roads?%SPEECH_OFF%Shaking your head, you ask what happened to her. She reveals her neck from which there are two holes. A bit of pus flows from each until she covers back up.%SPEECH_ON%My husband and I were attacked last night. I don't know where he is. I think they took him. They tried to take me, but the man attacking me must've smelled something foul because he got but a small taste before running off. Maybe it was my cooking. I always add too much garlic. My husband, he skipped dinner that night, that grouchy fool.%SPEECH_OFF%You put up a hand, slowing her down. You tell her to carefully explain who or what actually attacked. She nods and responds.%SPEECH_ON%Right, it was...%SPEECH_OFF%She pauses and her eyes seem to change attention, as if she blinked without closing a single eyelid. She glances back at you and smiles.%SPEECH_ON%Hello, have you seen an old man on the roads? He's my husband. We were attacked last night and I think they took him...%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_16.png[/img]You come to a tiny little town by the side of the path. An insular place where no doubt everyone knows everyone. Outside one of the hovels, there's the charred remains of a bonfire. The sickly black shape of a person is in the ruins. One of the townspeople comes over, tipping their strawhat up while tenting their hands on a pitchfork. He speaks rather cheerily.%SPEECH_ON%That right there is taking care of a problem once and for all.%SPEECH_OFF%Curious, you ask what happened. The man answers earnestly, as if happy to relive the moments.%SPEECH_ON%Well, that there deadened thing you see used to be %randomname%. The man lived yonder from here, in the backend parts of this backend town. He used to do readings, like you know, from bones and blood or some sorry sortition. Fool kept going on and on about how the dead were going to come back and kill us all. We don't take kindly to shamanistic reckonings so we gave him the straight-and-narrow side of what is right and lawful.%SPEECH_OFF%The man spits and nods.%SPEECH_ON%And that was that.%SPEECH_OFF%Almost as if on cue, the bonfire crumbles and the boneshards scatter. A plume of ash and smoke are all that remain. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_57.png[/img]You come across a graveyard off to the side of the path. The place is a mess. The plots are uncovered and the gravestones overturned and scattered. It is as if a horde of graverobbers descended upon the place and picked it clean. Except... they took the bodies too? %randombrother% stands at your side and shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%Cannibals?%SPEECH_OFF%This was not the work of cannibals, but you nod for that answer is more calming then what might be the truth: whatever was buried here got up and left on their own two feet... | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_46.png[/img]While marching, you come across an abandoned camp. %randombrother% walks through it and kick over a pan slick with oil. Rotten bacon and eggs spill into the grass. He turns his attention to some bags but comes up empty.\n"
"\n"
" The ground reveals fresh footprints. A clutter of them circle around what was the fire, but there is no dance in their evidence, instead it seems they were frantically rushing to and fro. Marching toward them is a horde of prints, shuffling and dragging their feet with no order. And then, as these two storied prints meet, only the latter continues forward.\n"
"\n"
" %randombrother% pulls back a bush to reveal a dead body. There's a shovel firmly slotted into its skull. The skin of it makes you think the person had been dead for at least two or three weeks - so the footprints are far too fresh for this body to have created them.

" %randombrother% 捂着嘴走上前。%SPEECH_ON%以旧神的名义，谁会干这种事？%SPEECH_OFF%你单膝跪地。 地上有很多足迹。 似乎是这个小孩被什么东西追赶，最终跑进了这个小灌木丛里。 可能是被什么勾住了，困在这里。 更多足迹追寻过来。还有更多。 然后留下带血的足迹离开。 这个小孩，剩下的躯体，被咬痕所覆盖。 你转向佣兵们，回答到。%SPEECH_ON%我认为这是什么东西，而不是谁干了这种事。 但是他们已经离开了。我敢打赌，就在我们前方两三天路程的地方，但是…%SPEECH_OFF%你数了数脚印，但是太多数不过来。%SPEECH_ON%我想不管那是啥…我们很快就能见到他了。%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_76.png[/img]你走进一个举着白色旗帜站在那的男人，旗帜中间是一个抽线的印章，饱经磨损的残留仍在风中飘扬。他点头。%SPEECH_ON%能看到鲜活的肉真是太好了。%SPEECH_OFF%好吧，这样的开场白是你没预料到的。 很自然的，你问他什么意思。他看起来有点怀疑。%SPEECH_ON%鲜活的肉。而不是白骨。 我最近看到太多这种东西了，所以，是的，看到鲜活的肉真不错。%SPEECH_OFF%你继续问，这人看见的是什么骨头。 他眯起眼睛，好像是要阻挡他更愿意忘记的追来的吹自过去的风。%SPEECH_ON%能走的东西。半夜闯进门的骨头。 杀死所有在他们面前的东西的骨头。 想看到更多和他们一样的骨头。 真的就是那种，那种骨头，你懂了吗？%SPEECH_OFF%他睁大眼睛，的脸色亮了起来。 他突然转身，向你倾了点。%SPEECH_ON%你应该不会碰巧是骨头做的吧，嗯？%SPEECH_OFF%觉察到言语中的威胁，%randombrother% 跳到你前面，做出在那名男子行动之前就结果他的姿态。 你让所有人都冷静一下。 陌生人显得很惬意，但是你让 %companyname% 小心围住他。 他根本没动，只是简单站在那里，任旗帜的最后一丝线缕飘入风中。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_40.png[/img]在路上有一个人。 他伏在地上，手边到处都是散落的卷轴。 他不停从一个卷轴跳到另一个，就像狗把东西弄满地东西那样玩一样。 He shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%不，不，不，不！ 我弄哪去了？啊！陌生人！ 我是说，呃，佣兵，呃，朋友！朋友？%SPEECH_OFF%你问这个人在做什么。 他手抖着回答道。%SPEECH_ON%我，呃，有个想法。 关于我们是谁，呃，曾经是。在过去。 Way before today, understand? 你当然看得到。%SPEECH_OFF%你看着那个人整理他的笔记，把它们塞进一个袋子里。他继续道。%SPEECH_ON%我想我们的过去又开始困扰我们了，亲爱的佣兵朋友先生，当他们来的时候，他们会把我们所有人都杀了。 因为他们想取回。 他们想要全部收回。%SPEECH_OFF%那人把袋子扔在肩上，点了点头。%SPEECH_ON%现在我还要去通知别人。 谢谢你听了这么会儿，呃，那么再见。%SPEECH_OFF%好吧…再见。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_75.png[/img]行军时，有什么东西在脚下发出了怪异的嘎吱嘎吱声。 你停下来，单膝着地。 擦去一些泥土，发现裂开的陶器的碎块。 它们好像是，或者曾经是，一件艺术品的一部分。 你把它们拼在一起，一个图画出现在你面前。%randombrother% 站在你后面问。%SPEECH_ON%那是啥？%SPEECH_OFF%你用一根指头拂过工艺品。 上面刻画着全副武装的手持矛的士兵，身后有更多使用长柄兵器的士兵，他们的阵型和森林一样厚密，他们的武器是由森林制作的。 他们看起来一步一步向前行进，以残忍的效率消灭所有挡住道路的敌人。\n"
"\n"
" 你试着把碎片捡起来。 从粘土里发出一种低沉的嗡嗡声，然后每个碎块都突然变成了粉末，从你指缝里流走。 这么古老…奇特…的东西。为什么在这个地方呢？ | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_11.png[/img]一个奇怪的人影拖着脚穿过小路。 你拔出剑，跟在后面，最后慢慢跟到了一个抱着婴儿的小女孩身后。 女孩转过身来看了看你，襁褓里的婴儿正舒舒服服地在她的怀里睡着。 你问他们在外面干什么。这个女孩耸耸肩。%SPEECH_ON%逃离邪恶的东西。%SPEECH_OFF%在问她什么意思之前，你仔细地环顾四周。 她回答的时候好像问题的答案太明显了。%SPEECH_ON%坏蛋。我们把它们埋得很好，但它们却坏了。 现在他们要杀了所有人。 所以我跑了。我逃避那些坏蛋。%SPEECH_OFF%她低头看着婴儿，然后朝外面的地面望去。%SPEECH_ON%劳驾，先生。我的祖父住在那边。 他在等我，就等我一个人。%SPEECH_OFF%你抓住她的肩膀，问她父母在哪里。 她甩开你的手。%SPEECH_ON%他们和坏人在一起。 对不起，我必须得动身了。%SPEECH_OFF%女孩抱着孩子，迅速没入灌木丛中。 她还这么小，之后几乎没发出任何声音，你几乎不怀疑，她的轻巧会让她安全到达目的地。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_91.png[/img]你在路上遇到一位老太太。 她一只手捂着脖子，另一只手向你挥手示意。 当你走近时，你发现她的白头发日趋势微，露出了脑门的一部分，她那滑稽的鼻子随着每一次呼吸都呼哧呼哧地响。 年龄在任何方面都很不友好。 可以预见她说话很吃力。%SPEECH_ON%你在路上看到一个老头吗？%SPEECH_OFF%你摇着头，问她发生了什么事。 她露出有两个洞的脖子。 两个洞都在流脓，直到她重新用手捂住。%SPEECH_ON%我和我丈夫昨晚被袭击了。 我不知道他在哪里。 我想他们带走了他。 他们想带走我，但那个袭击我的人一定是闻到了什么难闻的东西，因为他只尝了一小口就逃跑了。 也许是我做的饭。 我总是放太多的大蒜。 我丈夫那天晚上没吃饭，那个爱发牢骚的笨蛋。%SPEECH_OFF%你举起一只手，让她慢下来。 你要求她仔细解释到底是谁或什么东西攻击了她。 她点头回应。%SPEECH_ON%好吧，那是…%SPEECH_OFF%她停顿了一下，她的目光似乎突然改变了聚焦，就好像根本没有动过眼皮地眨眼了一样。 她回头瞥了你一眼，笑了。%SPEECH_ON%你好，你在路上看到一个老头了吗？ 那是我的丈夫。我们昨晚被袭击了，我想他们把他带走了…%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_16.png[/img]你来到了路边的一个小镇。 一个与世隔绝的地方，毫无疑问，这里的人们互相都认识。 在一间小屋外，有一堆烧焦的篝火残留物。 一个黢黑的病恹恹的人躺在废墟里。 一个镇民过来了，双手搭在干草叉上，掀开草帽。 他说话相当愉快。%SPEECH_ON%那儿正打算彻底的解决问题。%SPEECH_OFF%出于好奇，你问发生了什么事。 那人认真地回答，仿佛很高兴能重温那一刻。%SPEECH_ON%嗯，你看到的死掉的的东西曾经是 %randomname%。那个人就住在离这儿不远的地方，在这个后端城市的后端。 他过去经常阅读，就像你知道的那样，从骨头和血液中，或者一些令人感到不好的东西。 傻瓜不停地说着死人会怎样回来把我们都杀了。 我们无法对这种萨满式的审判保持仁慈，所以我们让他见识了正确又合法行为直接并且没度量的一面。%SPEECH_OFF%那个男人啐了一口，点头。%SPEECH_ON%就这样。%SPEECH_OFF%好像回应一样，篝火的残留物崩塌了，骨头碎片也四散。 只剩下一团灰烬和飘升的烟。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_57.png[/img]你在小路的一旁看到一片墓地。 这地方一片狼藉。 罐子被打开，墓碑被推翻散落一地。 就好像一群盗墓贼降临到到这个地方，把它搜刮得干干净净。 除了…他们连尸体也带走了？%randombrother% 站在你旁边摇了摇头。%SPEECH_ON%食人族？%SPEECH_OFF%这不是食人族干的事，但你点头表示同意，因为这个答案相比可能的真相更能让人心安：埋在这里的东西都爬了起来，用自己的双腿离开了… | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_46.png[/img]行军时，你遇到一个废弃的营地。%randombrother% 走过去，踢翻一个还有油的平底锅。 腐烂的培根和鸡蛋洒到草地上。 他把注意转到几个包上，但那是空的。\n"
"\n"
" 地面上露出了了新鲜的脚印。 在曾经是火的地方散乱围成一个圆，没有迹象表明跳过舞，相反，他们似乎在发疯似地跑来跑去。 有一大群脚印朝他们奔来，拖着脚没有秩序地行进。 在这之后，这两拨痕迹相遇，只留下了后者继续推进。\n"
"\n"
" %randombrother% 拉过一撮灌木丛，露出一具尸体。 有一把铁锹牢牢地插在它的脑袋里。 它的皮肤会让你觉得这个人已经死了至少两三个星期了－所以这些脚印对这个尸体来说太新鲜了，不可能是它造成的。 你不知道这里曾发生了什么，但绝不可能是什么好事。 继续行进时，%companyname% 的小伙子们应该保持警惕，因为有什么邪恶的东西正在这篇大陆大行其道。}"

You watch as elder healers go from wounded to wounded, but there isn't much to be done here. Passing their hands in the shape of aerial rites, these elder healers think it best that these fallen and falling warriors go into the next realm protected from whatever spirits lay beyond. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_21.png[/img]You come across two men laying by the side of a small road. They kick back at the sight of you, one raising a sword. It wobbles in his hand until he can no longer muster the strength to keep it up.%SPEECH_ON%Just let us die in peace.%SPEECH_OFF%A few more men emerge under the banner of %randomnoblehouse%. They nod and tell you to get on.%SPEECH_ON%Keep it moving, strangers.%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_88.png[/img]Both sides of the road are lined with wounded warriors, armored men splayed out, hands draped across their foreheads or clutching the nubs left over from limbs gone missing. In a nearby field there are signs of what battle had brought them to this state of grisly being. This sad lot of men, apparently, 'won' that fight. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_22.png[/img]You find a few noblemen of %randomnoblehouse% peering over a sea of skewered and slain men - apparently you just missed some epic battle. Amongst the dead and dying you watch as swordsman pick through the enemy wounded and finish them off. A few guards head you off.%SPEECH_ON%This ain't your war. Keep on moving or we'll make it yours.%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]You come across a few noblemen standing atop a hill. Guards immediately rush to you, swords drawn.%SPEECH_ON%Do you belong here?%SPEECH_OFF%You look beyond the group to see that scribes are writing down notes. And beyond the scribes lays a scene of incredible destruction, great swathes of dead men from some pointless battle or another.%SPEECH_ON%I asked you a question, stranger.%SPEECH_OFF%You glance back at the guard. The noblemen are also looking down at you now. Shaking your head, you order the %companyname% to get moving before y'all get into another ordeal. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_21.png[/img]You come across a woman cleaning the wounds of a well armored man. He's got some decent equipment on him, and a pair of very dim eyes stare up at you from the faceguard. Drawing out your sword, you tell the woman to step aside so you can finish the job and collect the goods. She shakes her head.%SPEECH_ON%If it's the armor you're interested in you'll have pay better attention. This man fought under the banner of %randomnoblehouse%, the rest of which stand over that hill yonder. They so much as peer over it while you shake us down, they'll be skewering you on stakes and hanging you for the crows.%SPEECH_OFF%Suspicious, you lock eyes with her. The woman doesn't so much as flinch, but she does eventually move away from the wounded man.%SPEECH_ON%If you think I'm lying, then have at it. Go on, take his life and take his gear.%SPEECH_OFF%You shake your head and tell the %companyname% to get going. No more than a few feet further up the road do you see what is seemingly half an army of the noble house's men lingering. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_88.png[/img]A few soldiers hobble past you on the road. Healers are tending to their wounds, and a few women bound after them, sobbing or moaning into their fisted hands. One of the men pauses at the sight of you.%SPEECH_ON%Don't try anything, mercenary. The rest of %randomnoblehouse%'s army marches just yonder.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and let the wounded troop pass. The army never does appear. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_07.png[/img]You come across a man being hounded by scoundrels. Seeing you, the thieves quickly take the fallen man's boots, pants, and bits of armor and one lopes off with a sword, the blade leveled across raised arms like some heretical thaumaturge carrying a relic of impossible yet brittle power.\n"

" When you get to the wounded soldier he raises his hands to the sky, your silhouette no doubt blurred between his splayed fingers. He says something which you do not hear and then he is dead.

He nods at you as you near.%SPEECH_ON%Mercenaries?%SPEECH_OFF%As you get closer, you see the sigil of %randomnoblehouse% stitched across an unfurled and trampled banner. You don't answer his question, instead looking around for an ambush or soldiers from his house. There are none. And the man himself has been stripped to his skivvies. He coughs and shifts as though to tilt the pain from one end of his body to the other.%SPEECH_ON%Yeah, I suppose you don't have to answer. I'll be dead soon anyhow. I'd feel a lot better if you didn't stick around to watch.%SPEECH_OFF%A pleading eye meets yours. With pity, you leave the man to a peaceful, lonely death. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_16.png[/img]You find a crippled man crawling toward a dead cow. He's got the banner of %randomnoblehouse% trailing behind him, a messied and shredded coattail if there ever was one. You watch as he nestls against the bosom of the animal and begins to suck on its teat. He tries each grayed nub in turn, though not a drop of milk is to be had for Death is the driest of counties. Sighing, he flops over and finally sees you.%SPEECH_ON%Ah hell, don't look at me like that.%SPEECH_OFF%You offer water and he takes a sip.%SPEECH_ON%Dreadful. I guess I won't miss this place much.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and think to speak, but you notice the man is staring straight ahead, his arms flat at his sides, and a couple of flies got news of his passing before you did. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]You come across a naked man clothed only in the torn banner of %randomnoblehouse%. A large black bird is eating his feet. He stares at it, then at you, explaining himself in embarrassment.%SPEECH_ON%It asked if it could have a bite.%SPEECH_OFF%You raise an eyebrow.%SPEECH_ON%And you said yes?%SPEECH_OFF%The man shrugs.%SPEECH_ON%I don't remember what I said.%SPEECH_OFF%With a crack, the beak rips off a toe.

The bird hops up to his head where there be easier pickings. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_94.png[/img]Walls of smoke curl beyond the eaves of a burning farmstead. The owners are all dead in the grass. A dog howls wildly and then runs off at the sight of you, as though you were there to finish the job. %randombrother% nods into a pile of weeds.%SPEECH_ON%They didn't even spare the youngins.%SPEECH_OFF%You spit and shake your head.%SPEECH_ON%No, they did not.%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_30.png[/img]Tufts of grey smoke pipe over a hill.

A dead dog is at the base of the tree and another headless mutt swings by its feet.

Whoever did this was quite thorough.%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_78.png[/img]%randombrother% points toward the horizon, more particularly toward tufts of smoke wafting lazily over a hillcrest.%SPEECH_ON%Should we go check it out?%SPEECH_OFF%A few riders, well-armed and with lances so long and large you know they seek only one thing - enormous and pitched battles. Not wanting to risk running into those responsible, and whatever army might be with them, you tell the men to stay low and carry on. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]A horse ablaze, scattering down the road hawing and crackling like some nightmare fetched from a desert sleep. You watch as the animal buckles and goes headfirst into a ditch where it rolls and pitches, stands, stumbles, and finally goes still.\n"
"\n"
" Turning down the road, you come to find a stable consumed by fires and a nearby hovel burnt to cinders. A few laymen are dead in the grass and their dogs, goats, and sheep and all else is there with them. You're not sure which side of the realm's war is responsible for this, but you've no desire to stick around and find out. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_54.png[/img]You come upon a hovel with fires blazing forth from its windows. There's a body in the grass, skinned and, by the looks on its face, it was a slow treatment.\n"

" Suddenly, the door to the home kicks open and a man on fire stumbles out. He takes one look at you and your men, screams, and simply goes back inside. The roof collapses and whatever terror was born here finally dies. You tell the %companyname% to get moving lest someone, or some large army, come to think it was you who did this. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_22.png[/img]You come across a soldier standing with his hands tented over the end of a spiked spear. He nods at you.%SPEECH_ON%'Ello. If I were you, I'd keep moving.%SPEECH_OFF%Looking around, you ask what the man is doing out here.%SPEECH_ON%Keeping watch for the army of %randomnoble%. We is at war, don'tcha know?%SPEECH_OFF%He spits and throws his hand out to the horizon.%SPEECH_ON%Rest of the army stands thataway. So I'd fly like a crooked bee and go around.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and take the man's advice. Sure enough, you eventually skirt around the edge of an enormous military camp. | An old man is founding squatting in the middle of a path. He's eating nuts and mushrooms.

You fly the most common banner of all, soldier. Would you like a mushroom?%SPEECH_OFF%He holds one up. It is mushed and muddied. You decline and order the men to get to marching again. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_37.png[/img]You come across a few men flying the %randomnoblehouse% banner. They're yanking dogs at the ends of their leashes, and the dogs are being separated from corpses, leashes of flesh pulled between their teeth and the bodies. Spotting you, one of the soldiers tells you off.%SPEECH_ON%We ain't got money for your services, mercenary, but I'll put an axe in that dumb face of yours if you don't move on.%SPEECH_OFF%There are far, far too many soldiers around to respond to that so you just nod and move on. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_36.png[/img]You spot a shepherd herding goats along a hillside. He spots you and waves.%SPEECH_ON%This is not the safest place for folks like me.%SPEECH_OFF%He kicks one of the goats along. It bays and blurts and froths, but moves along all the same, clambering and shuffling amongst its brothers. The man shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%This war between the noble houses has brought so much bloodshed to this land.%SPEECH_OFF%The shepherd boots along another of his flock.%SPEECH_ON%I guess it's only a matter of time until they come to me looking for milk, and then for meat, and then for me. Just another warm body thrown into the thresher these nobles call a 'grand honor' or some such shite.%SPEECH_OFF%You let the man and his herd pass before continuing on yourself. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_71.png[/img]You come across a man standing aside the ruins of what appear to be his home.%SPEECH_ON%Well, there goes all I had.%SPEECH_OFF%He seems rather calm about the whole affair. He spits and looks around.%SPEECH_ON%Hope they didn't take off with my dog.%SPEECH_OFF%The man lets out a sharp whistle, pauses, then nods grimly.%SPEECH_ON%Suppose they did.%SPEECH_OFF%He goes over his charcoaled hovel and begins to kick the wooden frames away.%SPEECH_ON%Excuse me, sir mercenary, I need to rebuild so that those damned %randomnoblehouse% grunts have something else to knock over the next time they come around. By the way, if you ever see a dog, any kind of dog, send it my way. Your company's nice, but I prefer the muttly sort of companionship.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and go on your way. Not far off you do find a dog, but it is in no state to be returned to anyone. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_30.png[/img]A fire consumes a farmstead, and the pyros responsible are just riding over a hill yonder. When they leave, you rush to the home and come to hear screams inside. The door has been jammed with shut with a wooden post. You kick it aside and instantly fires burst forth and a woman scatters out from the flames. She is in tatters, smoky and charcoaled and ghastly orange. It is too late. She falls into the grass and you can only step away.\n"
"\n"
" The hovel cracks and then collapses. A man barks out to you.%SPEECH_ON%Like what you see, mercenary? Why don't you go on and get going.%SPEECH_OFF%It's the bannermen of %randomnoblehouse% and there are far too many soldiers to start any sort of battle. You get on going. | The trees that line the path are creaking with ropes weighted with corpses. Every branch has found a use in this vocation - you count at least a dozen bodies swinging, most with sacks over their heads. The house words of %randomnoblehouse% have been carved into the base of the tree. There's a sort of haughty confidence in the typography. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]A few soldiers of %randomnoblehouse% stand beside a tree. It is caked with blood from treetop to its roots. You can hear the squash of the soldiers' boots as they step through it.%SPEECH_ON%Say, mercenary, do you think the dead could fertilize new trees?%SPEECH_OFF%The man sounds awfully educated to be a murderous soldier, but really you have no idea what fertilize means. You simply nod. He nods in return.%SPEECH_ON%Yeah, I figured as much. Well, I suppose in a couple years there's gonna be a whole forest thataway.%SPEECH_OFF%He points toward some distance, silhouettes of horror stacked high in the grass. The man bursts into laughter. You tell your men to get going before something stupid goes down. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]You come to find a few trees along the path have been cut down and their stumps sawed into spikes. This wasn't an artistic matter - bodies have been spiked there, grisly and cruel, faces appropriately contorted to the horrors that met them in the end. A few bannermen of %randomnoblehouse% stand nearby, seemingly happy with their work.%SPEECH_ON%Hey, mercenary. 'Wood' you please kindly move along?%SPEECH_OFF%He laughs and turns to the rest of his men.%SPEECH_ON%Get it?%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_95.png[/img]Moving along a path, you come across a bodies all clumped together. They're lying face down and naked. Wounds pepper their backs, superficial until they weren't. Whoever did this wanted to exact some amount of pain on these poor folks - and those creatures of crueler stock might still be around. You spot a banner of %randomnoblehouse% laying in the mud just nearby. That's enough to spur the %companyname% along before it can find trouble. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_75.png[/img]A few mounds of earth mottle the sides of the path you are on. Some mudworn shovels are nearby, and you can't help but notice that a hand is sticking forth from one of the graves. Uncovering it, you find a naked corpse, mouth full of dirt and beetles. You need not uncover the rest to know they're in a similar state. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]You come to find a body crucified to a signpost with %randomnoblehouse%'s sigil carved into his forehead. His hands help aide you in finding a nearby town, though his open mouth seems to shout to not go there. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_88.png[/img]Along the road lay rows of wounded men from one of %randomnoblehouse%'s armies. You watch as an elderly healer walks the lines, drill and scalpel in hand, tending to those souls who are loudest. He sets himself upon a particularly shrill fellow who is clutching a green and puckered nub where one of his legs used to be.\n"
"\n"
" The healer holds the wounded soldier down and with no trepidation in his trephination he begins to bore a hole into the man's skull. You wince at the screams. A moonly fluid seeps from the brainpan, chips of bone coursing along the froth, and as the sickly blue ruin pours over the man's face he appears to smile and be at ease, as though peace came by way of an augered and fevered dream. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_88.png[/img]A few of %randomnoblehouse%'s bannermen line up to see an elderly healer. You watch as the old man turns his patients this way and that, pressing his thumbs into their flesh, smelling their clothes, their hair, their blood. His summations are scribed into a scroll no one can see, and then he moves the men off to a side. You ask a lieutenant what is going on. He explains.%SPEECH_ON%We are seeing who is still fit to fight. If you are not fit, you go to the left, if you are fit, you go to the right.%SPEECH_OFF%Slowly, you realize not a single man is put to the left. Not even the one-legged or blind or wheezing. The lieutenant grins.%SPEECH_ON%I told the healer my requirements for going to the right and he seems to be following them satisfactorily.%SPEECH_OFF%You ask what those requirements might be. The lieutenant raises an eyebrow.%SPEECH_ON%Why, they must be breathing, of course! Don't tell the men that, though. Illusions of relaxation is nothing but decay to an army!%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_71.png[/img]A man is found along a path. He's missing both his legs, the nubs of their trunks in each hand as though he had no idea how he'd come to this state. With pitiful eyes, he glances up at you.%SPEECH_ON%What happened?%SPEECH_OFF%You shake your head. Seeing the banner of %randomnoblehouse%, though, you gather that he was attacked in the midst of the war amongst the nobles. The wounded man coughs and a rope of red spurts from one of the stumps. His face goes pale.%SPEECH_ON%Huh, I feel much better now. I think I'll do that again.%SPEECH_OFF%He gathers his breath to cough, smiles, and falls over. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_53.png[/img]You find a few men crawling about naked. They're dragging innards and loosely tethered limbs behind them, moaning and groaning like the refuse of a medical ward come alive. One glances up at you, the banner of %randomnoblehouse% stuffed into his mouth.%SPEECH_ON%Please...%SPEECH_OFF%He collapses. Another man grabs onto your boot, but you shake him off and he, too, dies in the moment. The rest stop moving one by one in turn. It appears as though they sought you as a savior and, upon getting the bad news, they died in disappointed union. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_75.png[/img]A man's slathered in blood, setting squat in the middle of a path, naked save for the metal knife he's biting down on.

The war is sparing no one. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_72.png[/img]You come to find a shepherd standing before a massacre.

" 沿着这条路转下去，你发现一个马厩被大火烧毁了，附近的一个小茅屋被烧成了灰烬。 有几个村民死在草地上，他们的狗、山羊、绵羊和其他一切都在那里。 你不确定这场屠杀是由王国的哪一方造成的，但你并不想留下来弄清原委。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_54.png[/img]你看见一间小屋，窗户里有熊熊燃烧的火焰。 草丛中有一具被剥了皮的尸体，从它脸上的表情来看，这是一次缓慢的处理。\n"
