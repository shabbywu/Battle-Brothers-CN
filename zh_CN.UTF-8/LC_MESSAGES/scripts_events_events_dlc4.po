"[img]gfx/ui/events/event_33.png[/img]{Fear comes over the camp, but you fetch %wildman% to your side. The wildman snorts and runs his hand along his nose as though you've inconvenienced whatever inexplicable notion he has of his own time. He raises an eyebrow as you suggest, to the best of your pantomiming abilities, that he go and seek out the noise. With little further suggestion, the man grunts and takes off into the woods.\n"

" You swear he's a good hundred meters off but you can still hear him barreling through the bushes making all the goddam noise in the world. The wild dogs quit their baying and in their place you hear a loud growl and the hoots of a smaller one. They bandy back and forth and you notice you can feel the ground tremoring beneath your feet. The vibrations falter and fade and the screaming halts altogether. Just as you begin to worry, the wildman walks back into camp. He sits beside the campfire, yawns, turns over, and falls asleep. It is as though he'd never left at all.}"

"[img]gfx/ui/events/event_33.png[/img]{恐惧笼罩着营地，但是你把 %wildman% 叫到身边。 野人哼的一声揉揉鼻子，你的做法让他摸不着头脑。 他挑了挑眉毛看着你，你手舞足蹈的比划表明想让他去找到噪音。 你掏空心思表明清楚后，这家伙才嘟囔着跑进了树林。\n"
"\n"
" 你发誓他离你已经有一百多米远，但你还是能听到他在灌木丛中发出奔驰的声音，发出这世上最该死的噪音。 野狗停止了吠叫，但接着那地方传来了一声大的咆哮和狗的一小声惨叫。 你的人佛口蛇心的讨论着，你能感到大地在颤动。 之后颤动减弱了和叫声一起直到消失。 你开始担心起来，这时候野人回来了。 他做在营火旁打了个哈欠，一翻身就睡着了。 好像他就没出去过一样。}"

"[img]gfx/ui/events/event_14.png[/img]{It does appear the men will not be assuaged by telling them to grow a pair. %hunter% elects to go seek out the noise, as he's sure it's nothing more than the wild dogs squabbling over primacy over the pack. You send him on his way, the man venturing into the dark all by his lonesome. Just as soon as he's gone the canines cease their crying and you hear a growl that seems as though it came from a much higher ground. The whole camp is dead silent, daring not to even move.\n"

" An hour later and the hunter walks into camp, nobody having heard him come in. He's camouflaged himself in mud slaked with twigs and leaves. He's grafted stems into a hood which he wears like some arboreal abbess. With hushed tones, the sellswords ask what he saw. He shrugs.%SPEECH_ON%Well. I seen about a dozen dead dogs. Some ripped apart. Found a few in the pit of very large footprints and they'd not found the print but had been stomped there, you know. And I saw something move along in the shadows between the tree tops and it went the other way and I did not follow. I found a deer dead on its feet leaning against a tree. Heart faltered by whatever it saw, I suppose. I harvested everything I could.%SPEECH_OFF%The man turns and slings forward a rack of meat strung to a paneling of wood and leaves.%SPEECH_ON%Anyone hungry?%SPEECH_OFF%} "

"[img]gfx/ui/events/event_14.png[/img]{加强警备似乎不会缓解这些人的情绪。%hunter% 决定去探明一下声音的问题，因为他觉得那不过是野狗为了争夺族群里的狗王才发出的声音。 你同意了，他冒险独自一人走进黑暗。 他一走进去那些狗就停止了叫声，紧接着你听到了类似低吼的声音从更高的地方传来。 整个营地甚至动都不敢动，一片死寂。\n"
"\n"
" 一个小时后他走进营地了，但没人听到他回来的动静。 他用泥巴和树叶把自己伪装起来。 帽子里插着树枝，看起来就像树林修女院院长。 大伙压低声音问他看到了什么。他耸耸肩。%SPEECH_ON%额。我看到了十几只死狗。 一些被撕碎了。一些在几个巨大的脚印坑里找到了，它们被踩死了，你懂的。 我还看见一些东西在树梢的阴影里移动，往另一个方向去了，我没跟着。 我发现有一只鹿撞在树上死了。 我想，管我看见的是什么我的心都害怕地发抖。 我已经竭尽所能。%SPEECH_OFF%他转过身来，掏出一吊子肉上面沾着树叶。%SPEECH_ON%有人饿了吗？%SPEECH_OFF%} "
