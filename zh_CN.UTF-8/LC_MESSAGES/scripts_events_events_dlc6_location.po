msgid "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_151.png[/img]{Empire's End. Metropolis of Ash. The Annihilation.\n\nWhatever its name, the ancient city is now a vast grey ruin. It sits beneath a mountain missing a peak, its once glorious shape obliterated in an enormous eruption. The explosion hit with such violence that shockwaves unfurled cobbled streets and sent the bricks showering over the city proper. Enormous granitic boulders cratered neighborhoods whole and boiling debris vaporized all in its way. The flow of lava came last, smoldering much of the city in a black sludge, the edges of which pillowed and toed in bulbous contours until it looked as though a cloud of black smoke had solidified. It is a horrid sight to behold, in part because the earthen rage also captured many victims in perpetuity: grey casts of ancient humans still stand to this day, posed in manners most lively like pairs shaking hands, one looking over a stove, another petting a dog.\n\nOf course, it is wholly within man's nature to see such relics of destruction and, distant as they are from its reality, flock to its remains, and vicariously revivify the violence through means of faith. Followers of the Gilder see it as a warning to not fall for profligacy and greed. Northerners see it as a clash between old gods, a rarity since the dawn of man. One faith or the other, both reside here in mutual respect for those whose lives were lost... respectful for now, at least.}"

Men and women listlessly shift around its pillars, the timid scratch of shoes across stone faintly filling the air, and day or night the architectural curvature brings a pale and somber shadow to its strange halls as though it were permitted eternity beneath the moon herself.\n\nPeople of all religions come to the Oracle with a shared sense of awe. Nobody knows which priestly being once dwelled there, nor what clerical colors they donned. Despite these mysteries, many believe that by sleeping inside the Oracle one can harness visions of their own future. An admirable faith to have, though you find it ironic these ethereal meanings must be sought by using the faithful's hands and feet to get there. For now, an impoverished and clustered tent city has glommed onto the Oracle's edges. It is a decrepit end for those who have so buoyed themselves to hope they've made themselves refugees of reality.}"

The unwarned issuances that can instantly shatter the greatest of kingdoms and disrobe the royal color from the greatest of kings.\n\nThe great caldera before you, then, stands as a stark reminder that not only are you small, but you might not even know just how small you are: it is quite clear to even the simplest of minds that the enormous rock at the crater's center came from above. Perhaps very far above. Northerners believe it is the coda of the great war of the old gods. It is a literal mountain weaponized by the deities, thrown like a stone from a catapult before landing with such apocalyptic damage that the horrors wrought ceased all heavenly conflict. Southerners see it as the 'fiery tear' of the Gilder. Looking down upon a world without man, the God fell into deep sadness and cried upon the earth. At first He was fearful that he had destroyed all that lay below, but instead He watched as Man drew up from the fires and armored himself in the ashes. And it is then that He knew Man, living in every corner of the earth, was His chosen beings, and Man knew Him.\n\nWhatever it is, the crater brings followers and believers from all directions. Here exists an amicable understanding that there shall be no impasses upon one another, though during times of religious war that unspoken agreement is oft shattered.}"
