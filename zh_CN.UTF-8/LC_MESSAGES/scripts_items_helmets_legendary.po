msgid "The Fangshire is a northern tiger's skull that nestles the faces of men deeply and darkly behind two ferocious fangs. Originally worn by Bjarund the Beastman, a fierce northern raider, it instilled fear into the hearts of his enemies as he went on bloody raids and burned down many a village along the coastline. When Bjarund was finally slain, Fangshire was taken as a trophy and went further south. Rumors proclaim that its wearer's eyes glow a sharpened yellow, allowing them to see through the very night."
msgstr "夏尔之牙是一个北方老虎的头骨，在两个凶猛的尖牙后面，深深地、黑暗地依偎着人类的脸。 最初是北方掠夺者比约兰戴着它，在他进行血腥袭击并烧毁海岸线上的许多村庄时，它向敌人的内心灌输了恐惧。 当比约兰最终被杀后，夏尔之牙被当作战利品运向了南方。 有传言说，佩戴者的眼睛发出一种尖锐的黄色光芒，让他们能看穿整个夜晚。"
