He believes himself blessed to be in the company of likeminded men who, thought not without fault, will try and do right in the world. | Some say %name% was an Oathtaker the moment he was born. It is the man himself who says this most often, though, which leads to some speculation that he was almost assuredly a terrible degenerate and he's just now making up for a horrific past. | When you think of an Oathtaker, %name% is about as clean as they come. Keeps his uniform and armor nice and tidy. Respects his superiors but is never mawkish. And he's absolutely excellent at directing steel through an Oathbringer's face. An outstanding Oathtaker if there ever was one. | Living in a faraway land, chasing honor and bringing death to Oathbringers, %name% heard of the %companyname%'s prestigious past and just had to find it and join up. He is a man of incredible resolve and most importantly he does not truck with Oathbringers. | Young Anselm's spirit has brought %name% to the %companyname%. Or so he says. Whatever brought him into the company, he is no doubt a talented fighter and will serve the outfit well. | The majesty of Young Anselm's spirit cannot be taken for granted. At least that is what %name% believes. He states that he is fights on behalf of the dead Oathtaker. Young Anselm must have been a spirited fellow indeed for this man is a wicked talent with any steel.  | Like many Oathtakers, %name% knows three divine elements: Young Anselm's spirit is to be cherished, Oaths are to be taken seriously, and all Oathbringers must die. Earning some coin on the side is also nice, which is why he has made his 'fourth' element fighting for outfits like the %companyname%. | It is a little peculiar for an Oathtaker to earn a sellsword's coin fighting, but %name% states that it was never forbidden by Young Anselm's teachings. Instead, it is the personal responsibility of the individual Oathtakers to maintain their oaths, which he can readily do cleaving enemies for the %companyname%. | %name% carries a ledger dedicated to only one kind of inventory: how many Oathbringers he's killed. He even has a list of when and where he did the deed, and of course how. The \"how\" entries even get a little extra dedication, with lines and lines meticulously describing how he dispatched his hated foes. Frankly, you like the man's enthusiasm. | %name%, a Oathtaker, is of such a singular mind it has you almost worried what he'd do without Young Anselm's directives. Now, that said, a part of you is curious how he'd fare dedicating himself to another craft. With his resolve and drive, he could probably weave an unbelievable basket, possibly even do it underwater like those learned experts. | %name% is everything one would want in an honorable man: smart, fit, and quite good swinging some steel. His dedication to the Oaths is only matched by his ability to absolutely demolish those who stand in his way. A perfect fit for the %companyname%, truly. | With the %companyname% gaining renown, it is becoming one of the more notable outfits in the land. Naturally, a talented and honorable man like %name% would seek to join up, albeit at a cost. His services to Young Anselm's cause mean his attention is no doubt split, but even being consumed by righteousness he is still an indefatigable fighter worth having in the %companyname%.}"
