msgid "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_180.png[/img]Any weak man can kneel, but to do so from a position of strength is true humility. While the %companyname% could have sought to wield its fame to make new fortunes, it instead stood aside, dedicating portions of its wealth to the needy and back to the communities who were offering these contracts in the first place. Many of the men have learned well from this experience and there is some hope that the methods deployed will be of use going forward, whether in this life or the next.\n\nThe %companyname% are ready to take on their next challenge."
