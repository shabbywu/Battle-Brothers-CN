He looks you up and down as the tin scrapes and skitters over his fingernail and back again.%SPEECH_ON%I suspect I should have seen this coming. Men seek power, and those cut from the barbarian cloth are no different.%SPEECH_OFF%He lets the crown slide down to his knuckles where it hangs limply.%SPEECH_ON%The barbarians to the %direction% in the region of %region% are uniting under a so-called king. A savage so strong and nasty he threatens to get a horde and after that, well, I suspect he'll want to expand his realm south. I need you to go to this region, find this man, and cut him down.%SPEECH_OFF% | One of %employer%'s servants fetches you to a garden where you find the man tending to a tomato plant. He's pruning it with goat shears and nodding to his own handiwork. He talks loosely.%SPEECH_ON%My scouts tell me that a northern savage in %region% is gathering an army. A gathering of idiots is not too out of the ordinary for those primitives, but I do believe this one is proclaiming himself king. And kings, well, they wish to be suzerain over more than just what they got. They want what everyone else has got. What I got.%SPEECH_OFF%The man pauses and nods to you.%SPEECH_ON%I need you to go to the region of %region%, find this so-called savage king, and kill him. It will not be easy, but you will be paid quite well.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% is surrounded by his lieutenants. They regard you with sneers, but %employer% ignores their judgments and makes his own.%SPEECH_ON%Ah, sellsword, I do believe a man of your chops is just the one I'm looking for. A barbarian in %region% has ordained himself king. He even wears a crown of some sort, probably of bone and antler, but it is the shape and purpose that matters. Not only matters to him, but to us. We can't allow him to live. I need you to go find this primitive and end him before he gathers an army too big for my fellow lieutenants here to deal with.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% welcomes you with a mug of ale. He himself enjoys a goblet of wine.%SPEECH_ON%I've brought you here because there is a certain primitive in the region of %region% that I need killing. He is calling himself king, heh, suzerain over the savages. Well, while I don't respect his royal authority in the slightest, I know a budding threat when I see one. I can't wait around for this barbarian to round up the villages and gather an army. I need you to find him and kill him. It won't be easy, but you'll be paid well.%SPEECH_OFF%You now wonder if he's slipping you ale to loosen you into accepting this absurd task. | %employer% is holding a pair of deer antlers with the crown still at the base. When he puts it on his desk it stands upright as though still attached to its authorship.%SPEECH_ON%Word on the wind is that a savage in %region% is gathering an army. He is proclaiming himself king and if he can wrangle those primitives under his banner then that no doubt makes him a strong sonuvabitch. It also means we may be in a heap of shit here real soon if he isn't taken care of.%SPEECH_OFF%The man knocks the antlers over and they fall upon their tips with hollow clacks.%SPEECH_ON%So that's what you're here for, sellsword. I need you to find this barbarian and put an end to him before he gets any wise ideas about what he is and isn't suzerain over.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer%'s sitting in his chair with pursed lips. He's thumbing a dagger around, the tip of it auguring a divot into his desk.%SPEECH_ON%My scouts to the %direction% started disappearing a little while ago. And then the survivors trickled in and with them tales of a barbarian proclaiming himself king of %region%. Now, do I need to conjure what the issue is with a savage ordaining himself ruler of a horde of primitives?%SPEECH_OFF%You tell him you can imagine it keeps him up at night. %employer% grins.%SPEECH_ON%Aye, that it does. So I need a man such as yourself, a strapping, nice, civilized sellsword. I need you to go and find this so-called king and kill him before he's got all those damn idiots marching under his banner.%SPEECH_OFF%}\""
