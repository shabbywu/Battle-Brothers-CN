Light fades quick and you can see very little inside. Above the entryway a relief depicts men pulling carts of scrolls.\\n\\n There's a set of words repeatedly scrawled across the relief. None of the languages look remotely familiar to anything you've ever heard or seen. It takes a bit of time until you can find a hurriedly etched translation left by someone approximal to your era: 'the Library, the Labyrinth of the Night, the Labyrinth of the Mind, Leave here as you would Leave a Dream, Tread here as you would Tread a Dream, Leave to Dwell upon the Horror of not Knowing, Enter to be One with Knowing, and in Knowing the Dream, Know the Nightmare'.%SPEECH_ON%Fair bit ominous, captain, but if you wanna go down in there we got the rope and torches to see to it.%SPEECH_OFF%%randombrother% tells you this, and the look on his face suggests he's hoping you decline the proposition.}\""
