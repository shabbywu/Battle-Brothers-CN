I took great strains to my own body, to really stress the lungs, followed by some ingredients courtesy of %ironlungs% himself. Then, naturally, additional elements which I shall not divulge to anyone, ever, for if this works I may yet be the expert in its field, a true hero to the sciences, and absolutely have one up and over other anatomists.%SPEECH_OFF%Alright. %ironlungs% appears from the tent now. You ask him what all happened. The man shrugs.%SPEECH_ON%I told him that I stretch a lot and have good posture, and that I do practice my breathing now and again. He refused these answers, convincing himself there must be some other way. Then he went full on nutbar with the tools he had and started, uh, 'working' on himself. Whatever he did looked mighty painful, but he took it in stride.%SPEECH_OFF%Wait, you practice your breathing?}",
