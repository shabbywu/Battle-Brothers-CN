He was the first to realize that the true nature of man required sacrifice. He believed, and rightly so, that when man first wandered the earth, he did so in a state of suffering, and it was in that being that he made his greatest advances. What we have now is so very far away from how things were. Things are simply too good now.%SPEECH_OFF%One of the kids scratches off a black scab and flicks it onto the face of another. The other kid wipes it away and pops a pustule and rubs the pus all over the other kid. While they quarrel, you continue on.%SPEECH_ON%Young Anselm realized this world needed to return to a life of sacrifice, to give up elements of what you enjoy, to sharpen oneself against the grindstone of suffering. Naturally, this made Young Anselm many enemies.%SPEECH_OFF%One of the kids looks up and asks how it was that Young Anselm died. You smile and say that is a story for another time.}\""
