Nearing the corpse, you look back to ask the %anatomist% what his plans are for the dead body. You see the anatomist is standing stiff, his head back and eyes open, a nervous and jittery hand pointing forward. You look back to see the corpse moving, slowly gathering itself off the ground, moaning, croaking. The helm juts forward as filth pours through its openings. You draw your sword.\\n\\nThe black knight pushes itself up off the ground, its gauntlets falling away to reveal pale flesh beneath. It turns to look at you and there's a slight hue of red glowing somewhere in that frothing helm. You slash the sword down and the creature's head falls free, clanking against the ground as air sputters out of its neckholes. Sheathing your sword, you tell %anatomist% that if he wants something to study, well, there it is.%SPEECH_ON%Also be sure to carry its armor back to the wagon. Make sure to use your legs when you bend, don't want you hurting your back or anything.%SPEECH_OFF%You walk past the anatomist. He stares, gobsmacked, then closes his mouth and pulls out a quill pen and some scrolls. His fear is put behind him, and his usual self comes to the fore.%SPEECH_ON%A fresh specimen, up close, recently deceased, or perhaps it is re-deceased? Either way...we can learn so much from this.%SPEECH_OFF%}\""
