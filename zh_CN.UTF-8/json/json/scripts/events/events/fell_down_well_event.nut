And it's not really a wellhead, we just call it that cause we're lazy. Back in my day we called it a... well, heh well, I actually done forgot. I guess a 'wellhead' makes sense now, as I'm not well in the head! Ho! Still got it. I was quite the charmer in my days, you see, and it's not often I get to put the practice in. M'wife died ten years ago, and the one prior to her left me twenty winters ago! I say winters, because that's when she left me, in the winter. It was a brutal one and I had asked her to help chop the wood lest we all freeze. She said she wasn't doing that shit and taking care of the kids at the same time. I had kids with her as well as with the second wife. Five total. One died. Measles. Another disappeared, so he's probably dead. I try to be honest to myself about it, but you know, there's hope. If a random stranger can be found in the forest to save me in the nick of time, then maybe my son survived that battle with the greenskins. Ain't heard of him, though. I pray to the old gods and even that Davkul fella every now and again. Do you know of Davkul? I'm not sure what to make of it. One time this man came by with a scar on his forehead, said he'd show me the way of darkness. I said I see darkness everytime I nap. This scarred fella said one day I won't wake and I said good! Ha! So then this scarred bastard starts getting upset with me...%SPEECH_OFF%As he drones on, you look around for %otherbrother% only to find him stepping out of the woman's home, the lady herself carrying a bit of... obvious warmth on her face. You retrieve your sellsword and leave before the old man lops your head with the most longwinded and one-sided conversation ever.",
