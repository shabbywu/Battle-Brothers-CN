Moss has long since overgrown the handle, and yet the metal of the tool is without error, not a smidge of rust upon it. Scraping the moss away, you uncover wooden fingertips still at full grip. Tracing the fingers ends at the tree trunk where the wrist becomes a vein of wood. You follow that along to a wooden face with a twisted maw, like a face of brown wax melted by time alone. The frame of a helmet twists around the face and there's a chest plate cresting below like the reservoir of a deerchaser.\n\nYou shake your head and retrieve the axe, breaking it free and throwing the wooden fingers off its handle. The misshapen face blankly observes your theft, its stare preserved in the very annihilation from which it is eons removed. You don't dwell on the sight and return to the company with the axe.}",
