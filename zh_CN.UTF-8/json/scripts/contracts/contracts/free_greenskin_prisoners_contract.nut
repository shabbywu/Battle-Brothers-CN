A few black birds squawk and fight over some spilt stew while feral dogs scamper at the very sight of you. Your men start searching through the goatskin tents left behind. There's nothing to be found until your foot suddenly depresses a little further into the ground than it should. You crouch down and swipe the camouflage away to reveal a trapdoor. Lifting it, you find a well chute the greenskins' had converted into a very vertical jail cell. The prisoners are squeezed together like tinder and look up at the light with withered, water-worn faces. %randombrother% looks down and grunts.%SPEECH_ON%Well, they're alive. I'll go get some rope.%SPEECH_OFF% | Footprints trail away from the camp. Judging by the spacing and littering of rubbish, they were in a hurry. %randombrother% calls out to you. He's standing outside a tent holding the flap open. When you get there, you see that it was used to house the prisoners. They're all naked and on the ground, ears plugged with twigs and eyes blindfolded. Looks like they've been beaten into not moving unless asked. There's a pile of human limbs in a corner and it looks like something had taken to using their skulls for primitive artwork. You shake your head.%SPEECH_ON%Free them and give them water. %employer% was probably hoping for the best with getting these men back, but this is just about what I expected.%SPEECH_OFF% | The greenskins' had abandoned their camp. You're not sure why, but most likely their scouts sighted your company and made a business decision to get out while they still could.\n\nThe men are ordered to look for the prisoners and it's not long until they're found: a goatskin tent with the men huddled beneath a pole with their hands bound and faces literally buried in the dirt. They've been given straws to breathe. %randombrother% hurries over and starts taking their heads out of the ground. Each man's face is purpled and gasping for air, but they're alive and the torture over. %employer% should be happy to see them coming back. | The encampment is found empty. %randombrother% picks up a spilt cauldron which leaks more sewage than stew. He drops it and shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%Fire's still crackling. They left in a hurry.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and order the men to fan out and look for the prisoners. No sooner than the words leave your lips do you hear someone screaming from a nearby tent. Inside, you find the prisoners - or those who have survived. On one side of the room the living are naked and huddled. On the other you see a pool of blood, an execution block, a red-stained mallet, and a couple of bodies pinched off at the heads like flowers used for bookmarks. %employer% won't be getting all his men back. | Entering the greenskins' encampment, {you find a goblin shoveling bones into a knapsack. It quickly drops its belongings. %randombrother% runs it down and puts a blade through it. | you find a wounded orc leaning against a pole. He's breathing heavy, but with a quick stab of his blade %randombrother% make sure he's not breathing at all.} The rest of the camp has been seemingly abandoned, this greenskin the last to remain. You find the prisoners in a tent. They've been blindfolded and a few are missing fingers or toes. %employer% will be most pleased. | The encampment has been abandoned, but the prisoners left behind. You rescue them, or what's left of them: some have had their fingers and toes removed, others breathe through holes where their noses used to be. But they're alive. That's what matters, right? | You come into an encampment which has been abandoned in a hurry. The greenskins most likely saw the %companyname% coming and made a smart decision to leave while they still could. The prisoners are, thankfully, found alive. They thank the old gods and bow before you like paupers before an oracular sage. You get the poor survivors water and prepare a return to %employer%. | A single orc is found at the encampment. It's resting against a cage where the prisoners are housed. One of the prisoners has a chain around the greenskin's neck and is pulling it against the bars, warden and prisoner clasped in a most ironic struggle. %randombrother% rushes over and puts a blade through the orc's eye and frees the men. The prisoners rush out of the cage kissing the earth and jumping for joy. A giddy man explains that the greenskins left in a hurry and it seems they were mighty scared. You nod and thumb over your shoulder at the sigil of the %companyname%.%SPEECH_ON%They were right to be.%SPEECH_OFF%}",
