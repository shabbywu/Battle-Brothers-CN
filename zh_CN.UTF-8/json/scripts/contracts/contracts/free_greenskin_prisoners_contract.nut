Thinking themselves already dead, most of the prisoners break down in tears and thank you for rescuing them. All in a day's work, really. | The greenskins have been defeated and you quickly head into their camp. You find the prisoners in a tent, huddled together with no clothes. The freedmen can hardly speak, but their eyes tell a lot about the horrors they've experienced. %randombrother% goes and gets some blankets to cover them up for the return trip to your employer, %employer%. | The greenskins have been dealt with, now you and your men start picking through their abandoned camp. You immediately hear people screaming from a tent. %randombrother% opens the flap to see a goblin waving a hot iron in front of a group of huddled, naked men. The sellsword cuts the creature's head off in a single swipe before it can even realize the reversal in its fortunes. The prisoners cry out, thanking you for the rescue. Your employer, %employer%, should be most pleased that at least some of his men will be coming home. | The greenskins defeated, you and the %companyname% rush into their encampment. There you find a goblin poking and prodding a man who has died from torture. %randombrother% grabs the unwitting goblin and puts a blade through the back of its skull. You follow blood trails into a nearby tent to find a group of blindfolded men huddled together. They skirt away from your voice, but you quickly make it clear that you're here to help them. The poor souls have been through a lot. Returning them to your employer, %employer%, and their homes should make for a good recovery. | Any thought the greenskins' had about coming out ahead in that fight have been put to rest: those savages are quite thoroughly dead.\n\nYou order the men to start searching through their encampment to try and find the prisoners. It isn't long until %randombrother% finds the men huddled underneath a tent. They've been beaten and tortured, but they'll live. A few thank you, and most others thank the old gods. Damn deities stealing your thunder yet again. Anyway, your employer, %employer%, will be most pleased. | The %companyname% dispatches the greenskins with ease and quickly rushes into their abandoned encampment. The horrors there are beyond comprehension. Men skewered on spits, others tentpoled into the sky on the ends of enormous stakes. Thankfully, there is still light in all this dark: the prisoners you were looking for are found. They're badly beaten, but they are alive. | The greenskins have been defeated. You venture into their encampment to find horrors glistening freshly red. Flayed figures strung up against racks of twisting thorn and tree branches. Grey bodies disemboweled, their gaunt and stretched faces still witnessing a most grotesque undoing. More men are found in a shallow trench, bound face down into frothy waters, great boulders placed upon their backs so they drowned with breath but an inch away.\n\nNot only are you worrying that there are no survivors, a part of you is hoping there are none. Such horrors were not meant to be carried forward. Unfortunately, %randombrother% beckons you over to a tent. Inside, a few prisoners huddle together, naked and shrinking from your presence. You order the %companyname% to get the men dressed, fed, and watered for the return trip to your employer, %employer%. | The %companyname% defeats the greenskins with relative ease and ducks into the savages' encampment. There you find humans made into holy totems, great obelisks of glistening bone and cairns of tilted skulls. %randombrother% calls you over to one of the goatskin tents. You rush over to find a few prisoners there, each squared away into a cage of tightly folded metal barbs. Each man is carefully freed, and each man opens up about the horrors which they had endured. You ensure the men that they will be returned to their families. | Having defeated the greenskins, you quickly rush into their camp to find the prisoners. They are seen latched to a long black chain. A frail orc with crooked eyes and malformed hands is trying to make off with the men. %randombrother% rushes forth and clubs the greenskin over the back of the head. It drops to the ground and rolls over onto a bulbous back. The misshapen and deformed creature calls out in an unlearned shout, some retardation of language beyond even the brutish orcish tongue. %randombrother% hesitates a moment, the orc's eyes only witness to a world it never understood, and then the man grits his teeth and stoves the creature's head in.\n\nYou free the prisoners who explain that they were about to be carted off by what might have been the tribe's idiot. Either way, they're saved now and %employer% will be most pleased to have them back! | The greenskins have been defeated and the prisoners are quickly saved from the savages' encampment. Each prisoner has a story of horror to tell, even the ones who speak not a word. Your employer, %employer%, will be most pleased. | Your employer, %employer%, probably didn't trust that this would happen, but after defeating the greenskins and driving into their encampment you manage to save the prisoners! They're not in the best health, but seeing the %companyname% instead of an orc with a firebrand or an executioner's axe has definitely lifted their spirits. | After defeating the greenskins, the %companyname% quickly rushes to the savages' encampment. There you find the prisoners tethered by ropes to a bear-baiting pole. One dead bear is in the mud, along with a couple of horrifically mauled men. The survivors, who apparently killed the animal with their bare hands, should be taken back to your employer in %townname% as soon as possible. | The %companyname% triumphs over the greenskins and rushes to find the prisoners in the savages' encampment. You're not sure if the soldiers are fit to ever fight again, but hopefully your employer, %employer%, treats them with care anyway.}",

Either way, they're saved now and %employer% will be most pleased to have them back! | The greenskins have been defeated and the prisoners are quickly saved from the savages' encampment.
