They regard you with sneers, but %employer% ignores their judgments and makes his own.%SPEECH_ON%Ah, sellsword, I do believe a man of your chops is just the one I'm looking for. A barbarian in %region% has ordained himself king. He even wears a crown of some sort, probably of bone and antler, but it is the shape and purpose that matters. Not only matters to him, but to us.

It also means we may be in a heap of shit here real soon if he isn't taken care of.%SPEECH_OFF%The man knocks the antlers over and they fall upon their tips with hollow clacks.%SPEECH_ON%So that's what you're here for, sellsword. I need you to find this barbarian and put an end to him before he gets any wise ideas about what he is and isn't suzerain over.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer%'s sitting in his chair with pursed lips.

Now, do I need to conjure what the issue is with a savage ordaining himself ruler of a horde of primitives?%SPEECH_OFF%You tell him you can imagine it keeps him up at night. %employer% grins.%SPEECH_ON%Aye, that it does. So I need a man such as yourself, a strapping, nice, civilized sellsword.
