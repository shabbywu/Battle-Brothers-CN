You shan't run out of business with us and your company will always be first in line for the best contracts. To sweeten the deal, I am to give you this marvellous weapon called %nameditem%.%SPEECH_OFF%You mull the idea over. Flipping sides is part-and-parcel of the mercenary life.

As a token of good faith, I am to give you this fine weapon called %nameditem%. If you agree, of course.%SPEECH_OFF%You carefully mull the offer as boardflipping should not be taken lightly. | A shadowy, dark figure comes down the path with a scroll outreached in one hand.%SPEECH_ON%Evening, the %companyname%. I come from %rivalhouse% with an offer of service. Abandon your benefactors and join us. You will find better and more plentiful contracts and, even better, you will be on the winning side of this war! If you agree, and as a token of good faith, you will receive this weapon called %nameditem%.%SPEECH_OFF%%randombrother% looks at you and shrugs.%SPEECH_ON%Not to step outside my rank, but I'd say this is worth thinking over.%SPEECH_OFF%Indeed it is. | You separate from the company to get a good lay of the land. While surveying the fields before you, a cloaked figure suddenly appears with something outreached. %randombrother% appears and tackles him to the ground and readies to put a blade through his face. The stranger puts his hands up, a rolled-up scroll in hand. You tell the man to stand and present himself. He states he is from %rivalhouse% and he has an offer for the %companyname%.%SPEECH_ON%Switch sides. As mercenaries, there is no honor to lose in doing this, and is in fact wholly expected of you. Chase the crowns, correct? Well, we have the most contracts with the best pay. That's what you are after, no?%SPEECH_OFF%The messenger fixes his clothes, straightening himself like a temporarily embarrassed ambassador.%SPEECH_ON%Additionally, if you choose to accept our offer, I am to give you this weapon known by the name of %nameditem% as a token of good faith.
