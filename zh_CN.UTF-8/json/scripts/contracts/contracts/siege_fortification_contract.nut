They are made to see the defeat of their defenders, blood still fresh and dripping. A beautiful and lathe woman is in the line and the commander pulls her out. He asks if she knows any of the dead. She points to a man whose face has been caved in. She recognizes the shriveled rose pinned to his uniform - she had given it to her husband that morning. %commander% apologizes for her loss then carefully ushers her back in line. He addresses the crowd with almost fatherly sternness.%SPEECH_ON%You people will be taken care of. We will rebuild and you will be fed. However, make no mistake, %objective% belongs to %noblefamily%. As long as we can agree on that, then all will be well for you.%SPEECH_OFF%}\""

Hungry men keeled over in pain, others leaning against the walls, chapped lips cracking as they beg for water. No animals are alive. They have all long since been slaughtered. Black birds do stare down from the walls, joining you in the conquest and just waiting for an opportunity to plunder. %commander% claps you on the shoulder and thanks you for the help. | The front gate rattles open and you walk through it like the victor that you are. However, the scene inside should dispel any notion that there was honor in defeating these poor souls. Dead defenders have been stacked in a corner. A few men have been crucified for cannibalism, but even those executed men show signs of being consumed. There's a burnt granary to one side of the courtyard. Some of the men sit with blackened mouths, apparently having tried to scarf down the charred remains of grain. Every single animal has been slaughtered and picked to the bone.\n\n %commander% laughs at the scene and tells his men to start shackling the prisoners. He turns to you.%SPEECH_ON%Thank you, sellsword. You can return to %employer% now.%SPEECH_OFF% | Inside the fort you find the defenders standing in a line. Two of %commander%'s soldiers are going down it, one hauling chains and the other taking those chains and shackling the men together. You see a corpse impaled atop a stable, having the weathervane blow out his chest and carrying his heart atop it like some visceral end to a ritual. %commander% comes over laughing.%SPEECH_ON%That was their lieutenant. {They said he refused to surrender and threw himself off the tower instead. | Apparently he refused to surrender so his men threw him off the tower.}%SPEECH_OFF%Interesting. Well, %employer% will be more than happy to see you again. | Beyond the walls, %commander%'s men are taking the defenders' weapons and heaving them into a great pile. The defenders themselves are huddled in a corner, each with their arms shackled behind their backs, their heads ducked low, their eyes staring at the mud. A few guards watch over them, occasionally kicking them, spitting on them, or even threatening to kill them. All in good fun.\n\n %commander% comes over and claps you on the back.%SPEECH_ON%Job well done, sellsword. Your help was much appreciated. Return to %employer%. Your work here is done.%SPEECH_OFF% | Walking through the gate, you find the defenders begging for mercy. Their lieutenant is dead in the mud, still leaking from dozens of stab wounds. One man explains.%SPEECH_ON%We wanted to surrender so long ago but he wouldn't let us! You have to understand! We want no more of this war.%SPEECH_OFF%%commander% walks up beside you and nods.%SPEECH_ON%Your work here is done, sellsword.

I try not to be rash about these things.%SPEECH_OFF%Fair enough. | You and %commander% walk through the opened gates. Inside, a few of the surviving defenders are keeled over, begging for food on their hands and knees. They can hardly bend their bodies upward to beg, their stomachs so pitted with pain.%SPEECH_ON%Please! Help...%SPEECH_OFF%%commander% puts a boot on one of the men and pushes him over.%SPEECH_ON%Do we look like help to you?%SPEECH_OFF%The commander turns to you.%SPEECH_ON%Good job, sellsword. Get on back to %employer. Your work here is done.%SPEECH_OFF% | Through the gate you find the defenders being rounded up and put into a corner. %commander% asks which of them is the leader. The group uniformly points across the courtyard. A dead man is hanging from one of the towers, pale faced with purpled hands and a purple nose.

I won't punish ye all for that. Sellsword! You get on back to %employer%. Your work here is done.%SPEECH_OFF% | Going through the gate, you find the fort's commander swinging a longsword around as a few of %commander%'s men corner him with spears. In one big uniform rush, they skewer him like a wild animal. Immobilized by the shafts, he gives up and keels forward, draping his arms over the wood like he was lazily leaning against some fenceposts.%SPEECH_ON%Alright, I suppose ye bastards got me.%SPEECH_OFF%He turns to his men who, it appears, were the ones to actually open the gates.%SPEECH_ON%I'll be seeing the lot of you in the next life.%SPEECH_OFF%Blood pours from his mouth and his body shakes once and that is all. The soldiers retrieve their spears and the leader falls straight into the mud. %commander% stands over him and addresses you.%SPEECH_ON%Alright, sellsword. Get on back to %employer%.%SPEECH_OFF% | The inside of the fort is a place of horror. Men are strewn about clutching their bellies, some already dead, some wishing they were. The commander of the place is hanging from a tower, a family banner wrapped around his neck as though that'd bring some dignity to his death. Bones of animals litter the courtyard and there is shit and piss and vomit potholed all about. %commander% comes to your side and nods.%SPEECH_ON%Looks about right. A shame they didn't surrender earlier.%SPEECH_OFF%You suggest that it was probably the dead lieutenant swinging by his own sigil that was resisting surrender. The commander nods again.%SPEECH_ON%Yeah. He thought that was the honorable thing to do. I'd probably done the same once upon a time, but having seen this, I'm not so sure he's right anymore.%SPEECH_OFF% | Walking through the gate, you find the defenders bunched up outside a place of worship. There aren't many left and not a one is praying. The dead have been piled into a corner and there's evidence of cannibalism. No animals are around. The stable is so busy with flies it's almost roaring with their frenetic buzzing. The pig pen has been outright trampled. One of the prisoners looks up at you.%SPEECH_ON%We ate all that we could.
