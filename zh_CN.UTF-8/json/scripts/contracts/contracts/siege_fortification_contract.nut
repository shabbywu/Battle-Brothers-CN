    "original": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_68.png[/img]{Flushing %objective%'s defenders out worked like a charm. You and the %commander% walk through the now undefended gate to see what's left of the place. Unfortunately, the fires burnt most of the place right to the ground. No matter, one of the professional soldiers hoists a banner of %noblefamily% atop one of the towers. You can hardly recognize the sigil through the cloud of swirling ash and smoke. | The battlefield is littered with the dead and dying. %commander%'s men pass through the mounds of corpses, occasionally stabbing their spears down into the ground and silencing what noise had been mewling there.\n\n You and the commander head through %objective%'s gate. The fires turned every wooden building to bony and charred frameworks. There are burnt farm animals all over the courtyard. %commander% shrugs and orders one of his men to raise the flag of %noblefamily% atop one of the towers so that all may know who won this day. | The battle is over. Flushing %objective%'s defenders out with fire more than likely saved many lives, but the beyond the gates everything has been cleansed by flames. It will take time to rebuild to its former glory, whatever that was. %commander% seems happy enough as he orders one of his men to raise the flag of %noblefamily% atop one of the towers. Its colorful linens snap crisply amongst shades of floating ash and smoke. | %commander% steps through the ashes of %objective%'s fortifications.%SPEECH_ON%Well, we got it. What's left of it anyway. I'm not going to complain, though. Good job, sellsword.%SPEECH_OFF% | %objective%'s citizens come out to see the remains of their defenses. The women pick through the charred bodies, looking for any sign of their loved ones. Instead, they just find their men burnt to charred and wiry skeletons, faces melted into grim visages that captured their final moments. One of %commander%'s men unfurls %noblefamily%'s banner over the front gate and the commander quickly points to it.%SPEECH_ON%Listen up! See that right there? That is who we are. Now, all you have to do is respect that and everything can go back to normal! Disrespect that, and I will bring you a new normal, got it?%SPEECH_OFF%The crowd of citizens quietly nod their heads. %commander% smiles and it is scarily genuine.%SPEECH_ON%Good! Now, does anyone here make a mean scrambled eggs?%SPEECH_OFF% | You and %commander% enter %objective%'s fortifications to find the coda of a fight for air itself. Blackened shapes, either man or beast, are found having clambered over one another. One man's hand is pulling back the charred remains of another man, his grip stretching back a rope of seared flesh. You cover your mouth to keep from vomiting. %commander% orders his men to raise %noblefamily%'s banner over the front gate. He claps you on the shoulder.%SPEECH_ON%Hey, good job out there, sellsword. You should breathe that stench in, though. It'll help you get used to it faster.%SPEECH_OFF% | You pass through %objective%'s walls holding a cloth to your nose. %commander% walks beside you, holding his head up high with a smugness that is of a stench of its own. Inside %objective%, you find bodies wired together through melted bone and flesh, reared teeth flashing out in gritty grimaces resonating the horrid finality of a burning death. %commander% slaps you on the shoulder.%SPEECH_ON%This was quite a victory, you know that? You should get on back to %employer%, unless you want to help cleanup.%SPEECH_OFF% | You and %commander% enter %objective% with swords raised, but there is nothing to fight: the inferno consumed every living thing. If they weren't burned to death, they can be found caked in the ash and smoke they choked on. %commander% kicks some rubble around, a charred body tumbling over as he does so.%SPEECH_ON%Hell, there ain't much here but the walls.%SPEECH_OFF%He looks at you sternly.%SPEECH_ON%But walls are everything.%SPEECH_OFF%You crouch down and look at the dead man.%SPEECH_ON%Do you think he thought the same?%SPEECH_OFF%The commander shrugs. He quickly turns away and orders one of his men to unfurl %noblefamily%'s banner over the front gate. | You step foot into %objective% and immediately regret it. There are bodies everywhere and not a one is remotely identifiable. The fire turned everything black, even the mud itself. %commander% uses his foot to try and turn over a corpse. Fleshen chips crunch and splinter as though he'd stepped on a thin layer of ice. The man scrunches his nose.%SPEECH_ON%Now that is unsightly, don't you think?%SPEECH_OFF%He turns and lets out a sharp whistle before pointing at one of his soldiers.%SPEECH_ON%You! Raise the %noblefamily% banner over the gates and towers!%SPEECH_OFF%The soldier salutes and rushes off to his duty. %commander% slaps you on the shoulder and says %employer% should be most happy with these results. | There isn't much to recover from %objective%'s fortifications: the fires consumed damn near everything. Those who stayed, burned. Those who rushed to the towers for safety, suffocated. The faces of the dead tell both stories in explicit terms - it was not a good way to go. But %commander% seems happy, ordering his men to start cleaning up and unfurling the %noblefamily% banners. | You pick through the remains of %objective%. The dead bodies draw your eye because you've never seen so many burnt corpses in one place. One is clutching a tiny shape that, upon a closer look, is revealed to be an infant. %commander% walks up and claps you on the shoulder.%SPEECH_ON%Ah, that's a shame. Hey, you did a good job, sellsword. Don't think twice about nothing, got it?%SPEECH_OFF%You nod. The commander smiles briefly before ordering his men to start flying %noblefamily%'s banners everywhere they can. Best to let strangers know that this burnt husk of a fort has new owners. | Inside %objective%, you find all manner of charred chaos. Dead dogs that were set aflame, their chains smoldering them long before the fires could. Horses stuck in stables with their blackened legs stiff in the air. Pigs that broke through their fences and ran wild, no doubt on fire the whole time. A faint aroma of bacon barely undercutting the otherwise horrid stench. There was no escape for any of these creatures.\n\n You open the door to a storage room and find a pile of defenders that suffocated to death. %commander% comes to stand behind you, looking in.%SPEECH_ON%Poor blokes. They look young. Probably stable hands, squires. What a shame.%SPEECH_OFF%The commander leans into the room and knocks some straw off a loaf of bread. He peels the outer layer away to reveal a fresh core.%SPEECH_ON%Hey, you hungry?%SPEECH_OFF%You politely decline the offer.}",

Go there, help the commander with whatever he needs, and you will be paid %reward% crowns. | You stop outside %employer%'s door and ask yourself, Do you need this shit in your life? Suddenly, a servant bumps into you with a chest of crowns. He asks if %employer% is inside because the %reward% crowns are ready for delivery to the sellsword.

There are two large dogs napping at his feet and a purring cat in his lap. He is completely clonked out, snoring loudly with a dripping goblet somehow still wrenched in an outstretched arm. A man adorned in a general's attire beckons you across the room.%SPEECH_ON%Don't mind the lord. The war has weighed heavy on his mind. Now, listen. I've got my orders, and I've got yours. We need you to go to %objective% and help commander %commander% in sieging the fortifications there. That is all.%SPEECH_OFF%You inquire about pay. The general's face sours.%SPEECH_ON%Yes. Pay. Of course. I was to promise you %reward% crowns. I hope it is sufficient for your... honorable services.%SPEECH_OFF%Those final words seem to pain the man. It is clear he's been instructed to be as diplomatic as possible. | One of %employer%'s generals meets you outside in the hall.%SPEECH_ON%The lordship is busy.%SPEECH_OFF%He plants a scroll in your chest. You unfurl it and read. Per the writing, one commander %commander% is currently sieging %objective% and needs help. No doubt this is where the %companyname% is supposed to come in. You look up at the man. He grumbles and speaks through gritted teeth.%SPEECH_ON%Your pay is to be %reward% crowns, your honorable sellsword.%SPEECH_OFF%Those last words seem coached. | You find %employer% and he takes you out to his personal kennels. He throws scraps to the dogs as he walks and talks.%SPEECH_ON%The war is going great.

I need you to go to %objective% to aid commander %commander% who is leading the siege there. %reward% crowns will be paid for your help.%SPEECH_OFF%A servant runs over with a live chicken. The nobleman takes it by the legs and heaves it into a cage of barking dogs. The poultry flaps madly, bouncing along a sea of jawing canines before suddenly getting snatched down.
