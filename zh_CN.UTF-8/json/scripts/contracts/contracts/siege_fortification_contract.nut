However, the scene inside should dispel any notion that there was honor in defeating these poor souls. Dead defenders have been stacked in a corner. A few men have been crucified for cannibalism, but even those executed men show signs of being consumed. There's a burnt granary to one side of the courtyard. Some of the men sit with blackened mouths, apparently having tried to scarf down the charred remains of grain. Every single animal has been slaughtered and picked to the bone.\n\n %commander% laughs at the scene and tells his men to start shackling the prisoners.

Two of %commander%'s soldiers are going down it, one hauling chains and the other taking those chains and shackling the men together.

Well, %employer% will be more than happy to see you again. | Beyond the walls, %commander%'s men are taking the defenders' weapons and heaving them into a great pile. The defenders themselves are huddled in a corner, each with their arms shackled behind their backs, their heads ducked low, their eyes staring at the mud. A few guards watch over them, occasionally kicking them, spitting on them, or even threatening to kill them. All in good fun.\n\n %commander% comes over and claps you on the back.%SPEECH_ON%Job well done, sellsword. Your help was much appreciated. Return to %employer%. Your work here is done.%SPEECH_OFF% | Walking through the gate, you find the defenders begging for mercy. Their lieutenant is dead in the mud, still leaking from dozens of stab wounds.

Your work here is done.%SPEECH_OFF% | Going through the gate, you find the fort's commander swinging a longsword around as a few of %commander%'s men corner him with spears. In one big uniform rush, they skewer him like a wild animal. Immobilized by the shafts, he gives up and keels forward, draping his arms over the wood like he was lazily leaning against some fenceposts.%SPEECH_ON%Alright, I suppose ye bastards got me.%SPEECH_OFF%He turns to his men who, it appears, were the ones to actually open the gates.%SPEECH_ON%I'll be seeing the lot of you in the next life.%SPEECH_OFF%Blood pours from his mouth and his body shakes once and that is all.
