One claps you on the shoulder.%SPEECH_ON%That was awfully funny to watch, mercenary, and my men needed the lift. Thank you.%SPEECH_OFF% | Taking a look around, you see the guards are frail, bony men standing watch over townspeople who look almost half-dead already. The muddied roads are littered with shite, garbage, and animal carcasses. Women and children weep at a makeshift graveyard: a ditch with a scroll of names penned above it, ink freshly renewed for another addition. | You enter through the gates of %objective% and find a few guards standing guard with thin hands tented atop spears.

The mutt dodges the slow tackles of a hungry crowd and disappears entirely. A grinning guard walks over, using a stick to balance himself.%SPEECH_ON%Evenin', sellsword.

Villagers shamble about, nothing to do but go hungrier and hungrier, and guards share jokes like they would food, laughing painfully while clutching their stomachs.

The defense's lieutenant welcomes you bluntly.%SPEECH_ON%Thank ye for comin' sellsword, but you should have stayed home.%SPEECH_OFF% | The front gates of %objective% lurch ajar and slowly wheel open as the doorhandlers struggle to push the mechanisms forward.

Well, maybe they do, but they ain't no harm to nobody.%SPEECH_OFF%You think to mention the horrid stench, but realize that they probably got used to it ages ago. | Beyond the cluttered gates of %objective% you find a town that might as well have already succumbed to the undead hordes. Villagers shuffle around aimless and despondent. A few guardsmen stand beside a wagon going from home to home, giving out rations. You see a few defenders asleep along the fortifications walls, arms half strung along the crenelations and gripping their weapons, looking like puppets thrown in a corner. The lieutenant of the defense comes over.%SPEECH_ON%Thank you for comin', sellsword. Many of us didn't think you would on account of this being hell itself.%SPEECH_OFF% | The front gates to %objective% are opened up and you pass through. Inside, you find two guards dragging a corpse toward a burning pile of bodies. A woman clutches at the boots of the dead man, begging them to let her have one last look. They ignore her and heave it into the fire and she falls before the pyre, slumping over as the skin of her husband crackles and pops. The defense's lieutenant comes over. He claps you on the shoulder.%SPEECH_ON%Glad you're here, sellsword.%SPEECH_OFF% | Through the gates of %objective% you're met by a man who grips you by the collar.%SPEECH_ON%You got food on ye? Hmm?

Apparently, your awkward trip through to their front gate was of at least some amusement. | Bumbling and trundling as they are, the %companyname% finally passes through the front gate. Inside, the guards are standing with amused despondence, looking like they just stepped out of a horrific battle to be witnesses to a strange joke. One claps you on the shoulder.%SPEECH_ON%That was awfully funny to watch, mercenary, and my men needed the lift. Thank you.%SPEECH_OFF% | Taking a look around, you see the guards are frail, bony men standing watch over townspeople who look almost half-dead already. The muddied roads are littered with shite, garbage, and animal carcasses. Women and children weep at a makeshift graveyard: a ditch with a scroll of names penned above it, ink freshly renewed for another addition. | You enter through the gates of %objective% and find a few guards standing guard with thin hands tented atop spears. Their clothes shift about their bones like curtains astride an open window. The sense of hunger lingers thick in the air, reflected in the lip-smacking stares you're getting for just being here in good health. One of the defenders greets you warmly enough.%SPEECH_ON%We're tired and a wee bit hungry, but we'll manage. The fight is still in us, don't you doubt that.%SPEECH_OFF% | When you enter through the gates of %objective%, a dog is the first to greet you, licking your legs and sniffing deeply up your trousers. A man suddenly comes hollering, club raised, and soon man and animal go skittering down the muddied road, both seemingly barking. The mutt dodges the slow tackles of a hungry crowd and disappears entirely. A grinning guard walks over, using a stick to balance himself.%SPEECH_ON%Evenin', sellsword. Food stocks are a bit low and that there doggo is fair game in a land of empty bellies.%SPEECH_OFF%You ask if they can still fight and the man laughs.%SPEECH_ON%Hell, a fight's all we got left!%SPEECH_OFF% | Entering through the front gates of %objective% is like walking beyond the veils of normalcy into the pits of the hells. Villagers shamble about, nothing to do but go hungrier and hungrier, and guards share jokes like they would food, laughing painfully while clutching their stomachs. The head of the defense comes over. He's unshaven, scarred, slackjawed, eyes looking labored with labored lookin'. Although he stands a foot away, it's like he's staring at you from another world.%SPEECH_ON%Glad you made it, sellsword. We could certainly use your help these days.%SPEECH_OFF% | You pass through the gates of %objective% to find hell itself awaiting you. Guards stand at the ready like skeletons propped by a madman, and the villagers stand idle or lying in the dirt or leaning face-first against the walls. Children stand atop thatched roofs and pick through the straw in search of bugs. The defense's lieutenant welcomes you bluntly.%SPEECH_ON%Thank ye for comin' sellsword, but you should have stayed home.%SPEECH_OFF% | The front gates of %objective% lurch ajar and slowly wheel open as the doorhandlers struggle to push the mechanisms forward. You enter the town to find a bunch of sextons digging a massive ditch right off the path. They're dumping bodies in and preparing fires to burn the corpses. The defense's lieutenant walks over.%SPEECH_ON%Sometimes the dead come back, but we learned ashes don't. Well, maybe they do, but they ain't no harm to nobody.%SPEECH_OFF%You think to mention the horrid stench, but realize that they probably got used to it ages ago. | Beyond the cluttered gates of %objective% you find a town that might as well have already succumbed to the undead hordes. Villagers shuffle around aimless and despondent. A few guardsmen stand beside a wagon going from home to home, giving out rations. You see a few defenders asleep along the fortifications walls, arms half strung along the crenelations and gripping their weapons, looking like puppets thrown in a corner. The lieutenant of the defense comes over.%SPEECH_ON%Thank you for comin', sellsword. Many of us didn't think you would on account of this being hell itself.%SPEECH_OFF% | The front gates to %objective% are opened up and you pass through. Inside, you find two guards dragging a corpse toward a burning pile of bodies. A woman clutches at the boots of the dead man, begging them to let her have one last look. They ignore her and heave it into the fire and she falls before the pyre, slumping over as the skin of her husband crackles and pops. The defense's lieutenant comes over. He claps you on the shoulder.%SPEECH_ON%Glad you're here, sellsword.%SPEECH_OFF% | Through the gates of %objective% you're met by a man who grips you by the collar.%SPEECH_ON%You got food on ye? Hmm? I can smell it, or are you food itself?%SPEECH_OFF%A guard pries him away with the end of a spear. The crazy man clutches his stomach and talks in between picking nits off his eyebrows and eating them.%SPEECH_ON%Y'all brought more swords here, but swords ain't what we need!%SPEECH_OFF%The guards take the man away as the lieutenant walks over.%SPEECH_ON%Don't mind him. He used to be a fatter, flubbier man so he's taking special umbrage with the recent developments. We've still got food here, it just has to be rationed. Your swords are most appreciated mercenary and, make no mistake, you'll be using them shortly.%SPEECH_OFF% | You step through the gates of %objective% and are met with the smell of burnt flesh. There's a smoldering pile of corpses, a guard standing beside it with a stick, stirring the ashes like a chef would a cauldron. Villagers stand beside the charred remains, making religious rites in the air and wiping tears. The town's lieutenant walks over.%SPEECH_ON%Attacks can come from anywhere. The dead, they come back, and we is a suffering town. This here pile was a family. The wife died in the night and, through the cover of darkness, ate and ate and ate. We burn all the bodies. You have to.%SPEECH_OFF%The lieutenant sees you cringing. He lightens up with a smile.%SPEECH_ON%So how's your day going?%SPEECH_OFF%}\""

The rider's cradling a handless arm and his face has been carved free of an ear and eye. The lieutenant rushes over and the two talk before the scout passes out. Sighing, the lieutenant comes to stand.%SPEECH_ON%The undead are attacking, prepare yourselves!

Shambling, shuffling, trundling over the horizon.\n\n You whistle at a man standing in a bell tower and point to the sighting. He straightens up so fast his metal cap falls off and clanks down the stone tower. He hurriedly rings the bell, the great bongs silencing the cruel canine commotion below. Man and mongrel stop to look up, a dreary silence settling over them all. Slowly, the din of death, groaning and growling, seeps into the very air. The lieutenant of the guards jumps into the scene, weapon already drawn out.%SPEECH_ON%To arms, men! To arms!%SPEECH_OFF% | One undead corpse shambles outside the wall of %objective%.

Ring the alarms!%SPEECH_OFF%You look over the walls and see a sea of grey surfacing on the horizon, bobbing and trundling.

Seeing enough, you go up the walls to find the lieutenant of the guards eyeing the horizon with a scope. He lowers it grimly.%SPEECH_ON%Well fark me arseways, they're coming.%SPEECH_OFF%He hands you the glass and you take a look. A throng of fish-eyed, warped-looking undead are shambling toward %objective%.

Get up there, cut him free, and take his post!%SPEECH_OFF%Another guardsman grunts and does as told, but when he gets atop the guard he stops following any orders.

The man turns to you with a look of hopefulness.%SPEECH_ON%Whatever they're paying ya, I hope yer worth every crown, sellsword.%SPEECH_OFF% | One of the guards has found a den of rats which is cause for depressingly incredible celebration. As the townsfolk cheer and weep, and the shrill cries of the rodents go into spits and fires, the lieutenant of the guards comes over.

Even from where you're standing you can see the whites in his frightened eyes.%SPEECH_ON%The dead are comin'! They're comin' to kill us all! We ain't have enough men!%SPEECH_OFF%The lieutenant tells the man to grow some balls, then quietly turns to you.%SPEECH_ON%Prepare your men, sellsword, and prove you're worth whatever they're paying ya.%SPEECH_OFF% | A guard was caught trying to desert.

He straightens up so fast his metal cap falls off and clanks down the stone tower. He hurriedly rings the bell, the great bongs silencing the cruel canine commotion below. Man and mongrel stop to look up, a dreary silence settling over them all. Slowly, the din of death, groaning and growling, seeps into the very air.

Not a moment later, the warning signals are sent out and %objective% is busy with men running to and fro' to arm themselves for yet another battle. | You meet the lieutenant of the guards along the walls.

The lieutenant points out toward the field.%SPEECH_ON%Oh, not much, they're just attacking again.%SPEECH_OFF%He hands you a scope. Looking through it, you see a huge crowd of corpses shambling toward %objective%. You lower the glass and ask the man why he hasn't raised the alarms. He shrugs.%SPEECH_ON%Giving the men an extra minute or two. The walking dead might want to kill us all, but they're not in a hurry about it, you know?%SPEECH_OFF%Understandable. You go ahead and have that bread on offer, then after another minute or two you go and prepare the %companyname% for battle. | One of the militiaman has taken a living dead man behind the walls. He's got it on the length of a chain, the corpse's arms cut off. There's a long, lolling tongue where the mouth should be. The lieutenant of the guards comes down. His face is so flush red he looks like he's gotta cuss like a drowning man needs to breathe.%SPEECH_ON%What in your mother's arsefarkin' bastard shite cuckchild hells do you think you're doing?%SPEECH_OFF%The militiaman yanks on the chain, pulling the undead to the ground. He nervously explains himself.%SPEECH_ON%Maybe we can learn something from them? Learn what makes them go, learn how to, I dunno, maybe bring them back?%SPEECH_OFF%Before the argument continues any longer, a shout breaks over the men. A guard atop the watchtower is warning of another assault. Spinning around, blade in hand, the lieutenant swiftly decapitates the dead man.

The lieutenant pulls the militiaman over by his collar.%SPEECH_ON%Don't you farkin' pull this shite again, you got it? They're dead. That's all there is to it.

How's this look?%SPEECH_OFF%The smith turns the blade up for your appraisal. Before you can answer, tolling alarm bells bong loudly, drawing a flurry of action as men rush to defend the town.

It was one of them rhetorical questions anyway.%SPEECH_OFF% | %objective%'s scribe walks about with a scroll of parchment. He's using the back of a servant to write whatever he's seeing. And you're curious, in this field of chaos, what is it he's seeing? The man answers you bluntly.%SPEECH_ON%Studying emotions. I feel sadness is a disease and it is spreading here.%SPEECH_OFF%A curious answer to a curious question demands a second round. You inquire about his research. He ignores the question and looks you up and down.%SPEECH_ON%By my metrics, you're in excellent health, sellsword. Well, except your body. You carry a limp like a maimed dog and you wince when you turn to the left. Easily noticed. But I can see the pain doesn't hold you back. In fact, I'd say it... drives you. Are you making up for something taken from you?%SPEECH_OFF%Before you can answer, which would have been to tell him to shut his mouth, alarm bells interrupt sound off. Men starting rushing to action and getting ready for the next undead attack. When you turn back, the scribe is already gone, standing in some far corner, using his sharp quill pen to furiously write on the back of his grimacing servant. | As you prepare to settle down and get some rest, alarm bells sound off and the watchmen along the walls chase the sound with a good dose of screaming. It appears the undead are attacking again! You hurry to get the %companyname% ready for another battle. | You notice that the tips of the walls have been blackened with buzzards. The large birds stare into the town, watching like a cloaked funeral procession. Suddenly, a militiaman emerges out the door of a watchtower and smashes one of the birds with a stick. There's a brief squawk and the rest of the buzzards shift on their feet like lily pads on a rippling pond. And then the militiaman cracks a second bird upside the head and the scavengers get a good inkling of what's going on and take flight. The hunter swings his haul by the feet and proudly returns to the watchtower.%SPEECH_ON%Hey.%SPEECH_OFF%The lieutenant of the guard taps your shoulder.

I'll do it, I'll talk to them!%SPEECH_OFF%The man gets up. A few try to drag him down, but he escapes their efforts. He runs to the walls and bails over. You rush to see the deranged fool sprinting across the fields - and right toward a huge wave of undead! Another guardsman starts shaking as he watches.%SPEECH_ON%By the old gods, more are coming? How could there possibly be more?%SPEECH_OFF%You ignore him and watch as the lunatic disappears in the crowd of corpses. Their ranks stagger to consume the intrusion before continuing on, like a pale pond briefly rippling from a rock. You yell out to your men.%SPEECH_ON%To battle, men! Into the fire we go again!%SPEECH_OFF% | One of the watchmen spots another attack coming! The man screams out so hard his voice breaks and he passes out. %objective%'s milita is at its wit's end, hopefully this is the last of the assaults! | A watchman whistles out a warning that more undead are coming. The lieutenant of the guards shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%By the old gods, will they ever stop coming? You're truly earning your keep this day, sellsword.%SPEECH_OFF%You think to joke about how you should earn more, but it just doesn't seem like a good time. Instead, you nod and go off to prepare the %companyname% for another battle. | While you and the lieutenant of the guard exchange war stories, a militiaman comes up. You notice that he's the man supposed to be watching the walls. He talks bluntly.%SPEECH_ON%Sirs, they're attacking again.%SPEECH_OFF%And just like that he turns on his heels and marches toward the town armory. You get up and help the lieutenant to his feet. He claps you on the shoulder with a terse, solemn smile.%SPEECH_ON%Into the fray again, huh?%SPEECH_OFF%You can only shrug.%SPEECH_ON%This is what we are here for. See you on the field, lieutenant.%SPEECH_OFF% | You stare over the walls of %objective% and see another wave of undead coming. All the excitement of previous attacks has gone. Now the defenders silently watch as the corpses shamble and shuffles onward. The lieutenant of the guard comes to your side.%SPEECH_ON%It has been an honor fighting by your side, sellsword.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and respond.%SPEECH_ON%Mmm, honor, of course.%SPEECH_OFF%The lieutenant eyes you.%SPEECH_ON%You're thinking about your pay, aren't you?%SPEECH_OFF%Nodding again, you respond.%SPEECH_ON%I'm thinking about what it'll buy: a warm bed, a warmer meal, and an even warmer wench.%SPEECH_OFF% | You stand at the walls of %objective% and look across the horizon. Another attack is coming, but there's no excitement in facing it. No screaming, no hysterics. Not anymore. It simply comes. A bulbous, shuffling ill-shapen army of corpses, bubbling and trundling forth, asking for yet another lancing. You order the %companyname% to prepare themselves. %randombrother% incredulously opens his arms, half his body caked in the sopping remains of undead torn asunder.%SPEECH_ON%Sir, I think we got it.%SPEECH_OFF%The men laugh and laugh, the militia joining in, and soon the hilarity fills the air, in part joined by the groaning of an increasingly close undead, madness made legion. | %randombrother% walks over to a campfire, drawing long strands of innards off his shoulders and slinging them away. A peasant eyes the viscera as though he's about one stomach growl away from taking a bite. The mercenary sits down with a discomfited plop.%SPEECH_ON%If I see one more corpse walking at me like it's lunchtime I'm gonna...%SPEECH_OFF%Before he can even finish the sentence, a watchman along the walls gasses himself out on a horn, bellowing a warning for all to hear. He drops it at his side, face red and out of breath.%SPEECH_ON%The... undead... they're attacking again!%SPEECH_OFF%The mercenary's face goes dead still. He stands up and, not saying a word, slowly goes to arm himself. | A farmer stands at the gates of %objective%. He's arguing with its keepers.%SPEECH_ON%Lemme out! You've surely fought them all and I wish to return to my farms. I'll have you know, I own two cows!%SPEECH_OFF%The man jets two fingers forward in case the listeners didn't get it. They shrug and open the gate, but the farmer doesn't move. Instead, he takes a step back.%SPEECH_ON%On second thought, the cows can wait for me to come home.%SPEECH_OFF%Beyond the walls, you see a huge horde of undead breaking over the horizon. Not a moment later, the warning signals are sent out and %objective% is busy with men running to and fro' to arm themselves for yet another battle. | You meet the lieutenant of the guards along the walls. He's sharing bread with some of the militiamen and offers you a piece. You decline and ask what's on the horizon. The lieutenant points out toward the field.%SPEECH_ON%Oh, not much, they're just attacking again.%SPEECH_OFF%He hands you a scope. Looking through it, you see a huge crowd of corpses shambling toward %objective%. You lower the glass and ask the man why he hasn't raised the alarms. He shrugs.%SPEECH_ON%Giving the men an extra minute or two. The walking dead might want to kill us all, but they're not in a hurry about it, you know?%SPEECH_OFF%Understandable. You go ahead and have that bread on offer, then after another minute or two you go and prepare the %companyname% for battle. | One of the militiaman has taken a living dead man behind the walls. He's got it on the length of a chain, the corpse's arms cut off. There's a long, lolling tongue where the mouth should be. The lieutenant of the guards comes down. His face is so flush red he looks like he's gotta cuss like a drowning man needs to breathe.%SPEECH_ON%What in your mother's arsefarkin' bastard shite cuckchild hells do you think you're doing?%SPEECH_OFF%The militiaman yanks on the chain, pulling the undead to the ground. He nervously explains himself.%SPEECH_ON%Maybe we can learn something from them? Learn what makes them go, learn how to, I dunno, maybe bring them back?%SPEECH_OFF%Before the argument continues any longer, a shout breaks over the men. A guard atop the watchtower is warning of another assault. Spinning around, blade in hand, the lieutenant swiftly decapitates the dead man. Its chinless head rolls right off the neck, the tongue flailing around the base like a snake in a jar. The lieutenant pulls the militiaman over by his collar.%SPEECH_ON%Don't you farkin' pull this shite again, you got it? They're dead. That's all there is to it. Now grab your goddam weapon.%SPEECH_OFF%The %companyname% already stands at the ready, not needing your say so. | You find the town blacksmith hammering away on %objective%'s 'finest' weapons. His burly arms swing hammers and grasp tongs like they were made of sticks. He's got a lemniscate tattooed on the curve of his hand. Ember flares spiraling around like firebugs, he quickly notices your shadow casting madly around his open-air shop.%SPEECH_ON%Hey there, sellsword.%SPEECH_OFF%Genuinely curious and sincerely bored, you ask how he's doing. He flattens out some steel and turns it over, repeating the process.%SPEECH_ON%Been better, naturally. Could be worse, supposedly. How's this look?%SPEECH_OFF%The smith turns the blade up for your appraisal. Before you can answer, tolling alarm bells bong loudly, drawing a flurry of action as men rush to defend the town. Militias start running past, grabbing arms off the hooks that ring his shop. He lowers the blade, laughing.%SPEECH_ON%Bah, go on and fight, sellsword. It was one of them rhetorical questions anyway.%SPEECH_OFF% | %objective%'s scribe walks about with a scroll of parchment. He's using the back of a servant to write whatever he's seeing. And you're curious, in this field of chaos, what is it he's seeing? The man answers you bluntly.%SPEECH_ON%Studying emotions. I feel sadness is a disease and it is spreading here.%SPEECH_OFF%A curious answer to a curious question demands a second round. You inquire about his research. He ignores the question and looks you up and down.%SPEECH_ON%By my metrics, you're in excellent health, sellsword. Well, except your body. You carry a limp like a maimed dog and you wince when you turn to the left. Easily noticed. But I can see the pain doesn't hold you back. In fact, I'd say it... drives you. Are you making up for something taken from you?%SPEECH_OFF%Before you can answer, which would have been to tell him to shut his mouth, alarm bells interrupt sound off. Men starting rushing to action and getting ready for the next undead attack. When you turn back, the scribe is already gone, standing in some far corner, using his sharp quill pen to furiously write on the back of his grimacing servant. | As you prepare to settle down and get some rest, alarm bells sound off and the watchmen along the walls chase the sound with a good dose of screaming. It appears the undead are attacking again! You hurry to get the %companyname% ready for another battle. | You notice that the tips of the walls have been blackened with buzzards. The large birds stare into the town, watching like a cloaked funeral procession. Suddenly, a militiaman emerges out the door of a watchtower and smashes one of the birds with a stick. There's a brief squawk and the rest of the buzzards shift on their feet like lily pads on a rippling pond. And then the militiaman cracks a second bird upside the head and the scavengers get a good inkling of what's going on and take flight. The hunter swings his haul by the feet and proudly returns to the watchtower.%SPEECH_ON%Hey.%SPEECH_OFF%The lieutenant of the guard taps your shoulder. When you turn, he thumbs over his own.%SPEECH_ON%Undead are attacking again. I ordered the men to keep the alarms quiet. You know, in case all our hollering and hysterics are actually drawing more of those bastards here.%SPEECH_OFF%Seems like a reasonable idea.}\""

Go there and ensure those people are safe and I will pay you well!%SPEECH_OFF% | You find %employer% overseeing a group of sextons lowering a casket into the ground. The coffin is firmly nailed shut, almost hurriedly so: nails corkscrew and bend off the wood, and there are scrape marks along the sides. Seeing you, the nobleman comes over.%SPEECH_ON%The resident of said box decided to come back out. Killed a child and a dog. Almost killed another before the guards put it back down.%SPEECH_OFF%A splurge of black liquid gushes from the bottom of the coffin. The gravediggers jump away, dropping the crate right into its grave with a heavy clatter. %employer% shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%With all these 'undead' outbreaks, my forces have been spread thin.

I need you to go to %objective% %direction% of here. My birds tell me it's under assault, more of these damned 'dead' come to life, if that's really the way to say it. Are you interested in going? The pay will more than compensate your efforts.%SPEECH_OFF% | You find %employer% watching over some masons putting sharply cut stones together. He shakes your hand.%SPEECH_ON%Building another monastery, sellsword, how does it look?%SPEECH_OFF%It looks good, but you point out that there is another abbey right across the road. The nobleman smirks.%SPEECH_ON%The dead are walking the earth again, there ain't enough pews around to sit the scared folk. Listen, I called you here because my forces are spread thin trying to handle this... oddity of undeath. There's a town just %direction% of here, %objective%, that desperately needs help. My birds tell me it's under attack and you seem just the man who'd be interested in saving it. For a price, of course.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer%, a treasurer, and a commander are talking. The treasurer says there's plenty of crowns, but the commander bluntly states that there are no men around with which to pay to fight. You, like the devil you are, enter the room and are immediately spoken of.%SPEECH_ON%Sellsword! Your services are needed immediately! We have a village %direction% of here, a little place called %objective%, that is under attack by these, er, what are they?%SPEECH_OFF%The commander leans toward the nobleman and whispers the answer. He rears back.%SPEECH_ON%Under attack by the... 'undead.' Sure. Would you be willing to go there and protect those poor people?%SPEECH_OFF% | You eventually find %employer% out in his stables.

If you go there and help protect the village, there will be a stout satchel of pay waiting for you here on your return.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% is found walking the walls of his fortification. The guards around him are unusually shaped up, straight backed, dutiful eyes looking for danger. Seeing you, the nobleman waves you over. Together, you stare between the crenelations. The land spreads out before you, enormous forests turned into mere dots, mountains into arrowhead, birds arcing in thick formations.%SPEECH_ON%%direction% of here lies %objective%. Messengers told me that it is under attack by some unbelievable force, undead to be exact. Yes, that unbelievable. Whatever assails their walls, I have not the men to handle it. But you, sellsword, your services would be most appropriate here. Would you be interested?%SPEECH_OFF% | You find %employer% and a gaunt scribe staring at a headless corpse laid across a slab of stone.

As I'm sure you've heard, the dead are walking the earth again and with that comes a great deal of speculation as to why.%SPEECH_OFF%The scribe looks up, interrupting.%SPEECH_ON%Or how...%SPEECH_OFF%Smiling, the nobleman continues.%SPEECH_ON%Anyway, %objective% %direction% of here is being assaulted by these very monsters, er, former humans?

Would you help save this town?%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% is listening to the pleas of a group of peasants. You've only arrived for the tail-end of the conversation as the nobleman angrily waves them off.

They go out the door without further protests, though one peasant glances at you and mouths 'help us' before turning away. %employer% waves his hand.%SPEECH_ON%Well, hell, if it isn't the sellsword!

I hope you spend those crowns well!%SPEECH_OFF%Before you can say anything, the man spins and leaves. The guard who handed you the crowns is already gone as well. Peasants walk around you like a signpost pointing to places they'll never go. | You find %employer% slapping and kicking a child around, eventually punting him into the dirt with swift boot to the chest. Seeing you, the nobleman wipes the sweat from his brow and explains himself.%SPEECH_ON%This doesn't concern you.%SPEECH_OFF%The kid is tilting on hands and knees, one hand to his belly, the other drawing blood from his leaking nose. Gradually, he gets to his feet, wavering there, blinkered eyes blinking crimson. A servant comes by and starts dabbing water over him, but the nobleman grabs the cloth and tosses it aside.%SPEECH_ON%You think he'll learn that way. If you want to help someone, help this sellsword. He is owed %reward_completion% crowns. Snap snap.%SPEECH_OFF%The servant nods and quickly leaves. You stay awhile, watching the beating continue. The kid doesn't cry or call out for there is learned expectation in this punishment. A few minutes pass when the servant suddenly reappears, satchel in hand. He hands it to you and whispers an earnest suggestion that you make your leave. | %employer% is stooped over his table, arms tented long and stiff, his head drooped low as he stares at a dead crow.%SPEECH_ON%Found this raven in my bed this morning. Just lying there. Dead. You've any idea what that means?%SPEECH_OFF%You suggest that it was, perhaps, a joke. The nobleman scoffs.%SPEECH_ON%Nay. I think this has to do with you, sellsword. You did well in saving that town, but perhaps it was not meant to be saved? Maybe that is what this bird represents. Maybe the dead shall come for me next as I have left Death itself unpaid.%SPEECH_OFF%You use this statement to slowly segue into the issue of your own pay. Despite his wild ravings, the nobleman does momentarily get his wits together to pay you your %reward_completion% crowns. | %employer% is listening to a group of scribes, somehow arranged in order of age and seniority. The youth of the group stay quiet, the only noise out of them is the scribbling of their quill pens. The elders argue amongst themselves, using volume just as much as reason and rationality. This seems a common sight nowadays, no doubt the dead climbing out of their graves being of some concern to men of philosophical takes. Regardless, you belch loudly to introduce yourself, shattering their conversation with disgusting aplomb. %employer% laughs and waves you in.%SPEECH_ON%Ah, sellsword! The man who gets things done, come to talk with the men who simply yap?%SPEECH_OFF%You shake your head and tell him you're only there for the pay. The nobleman nods.%SPEECH_ON%Of course. You did well in saving that town. I've heard much of your heroics. %reward_completion% crowns awaits you there in the corner.%SPEECH_OFF%You walk across the room, your boots filling the suddenly hollow room with quiet claps of leather on stone. The scribes twist to watch you, murmuring amongst themselves. You pick a satchel up, hearing the chink of crowns shift around with a most welcomed weight. You quietly leave, though the second the door closes behind you the scribes erupt with arguing once again. | %employer% is found with a few women beside him. They're telling him of their lost fathers, husbands, and brothers. He nods, attentively, though occasionally sparing a moment to glance at the bosom of the youngest girl.%SPEECH_ON%Yes, yes of course. Absolutely horrible. Horrible! Hold on one moment. Sellsword!%SPEECH_OFF%He waves you in. The women part as you make your entrance. The youngest gal looks you up and down, quickly wiping tears from her eyes and does a little bit of youthful primping. The nobleman sees this and glances between you and her.%SPEECH_ON%Ahem, yes, uh, your crowns are in the corner. You must go. Now. I've things to attend to.%SPEECH_OFF%He stands and points toward your %reward_completion% crowns, and in one swift motion takes the lady by the hand.%SPEECH_ON%Now, young backstress, you said your husband is dead and you've no one left in this life? Absolutely no one at all?%SPEECH_OFF% | Dogs chew up something in the path. Whatever it was, it once had life, bones and organs which have long since grown pale and rotten, though the mongrels rabid eating would suggest it might as well be a slab of steak. %employer% greets you, attentive guards at his side.%SPEECH_ON%My birds tell me the town was saved. You've done well, mercenary, better than I had thought you would. Your pay, as agreed upon.%SPEECH_OFF%He hands you a satchel of %reward_completion% crowns. The dogs pause, turning their heads toward you with flesh swinging from their teeth, narrow black eyes staring with an emptiness that reflects their hunger. The guards lower their spears and the dogs, somehow interpreting this correctly, slowly turn back to their dinner. | %employer% is found sitting low in his chair. He despondently waves you into the room.%SPEECH_ON%I've horrid news. My seer says I've brought a curse upon my land and my people. That's why the dead rise again.%SPEECH_OFF%You shrug and kindly state that the seer is full of shite. The nobleman shrugs.%SPEECH_ON%I sure hope so. What was it we agreed upon, %reward_completion% crowns?%SPEECH_OFF%You're tempted to say you agreed to more, but dare not cross a man who is so superstitious. When you answer, he smiles warmly at your accurate response.%SPEECH_ON%Good call, sellsword. You passed that test. I may be going mad, but I'm not one to trifle with.%SPEECH_OFF%You ask if your honesty will be rewarded. The man raises an eyebrow.%SPEECH_ON%Your head is on your shoulders, is it not?%SPEECH_OFF%Point taken. | %employer% is found on his balcony. You join him, though guards stand very nearby, eyeing you carefully. The man waves his arm to the town which lies beneath him.%SPEECH_ON%I know you did not save this town directly but, in a way, I think you did. Stopping the undead anywhere is as good as stopping them here. Would you agree?%SPEECH_OFF%The man punctuates the question with a satchel of %reward_completion% crowns. You take the pay and nod. He nods back.%SPEECH_ON%Glad you agree for we may yet need your services again.%SPEECH_OFF% | You step into %employer%'s darkened room. There are rugs over the windows and most of the candles are not lit. All the light flickers beside a scribe standing with a candelabra, his fire-red face grinning behind the candles like a little devil holding a trident. He glances at you and quietly sets the candles down. As he steps back, it is as though he were falling into a black pool, his disembodied face slowly dipping into the darkness. He's still there, breathing slightly, rustling his cloak, but you've naught a part of him to see. %employer% waves you in.%SPEECH_ON%Sellsword! By the old gods you did well in saving that town!%SPEECH_OFF%You step forward, glancing at the darkness which shifts around, some of it shadow, some of it man. %employer% hands you a satchel.

I have to more to study, more to learn.%SPEECH_OFF%You take your pay and slowly leave. As the door closes, you see the scribe reemerge like a gaunt specter, bony hands reaching for the light once more. | %employer% is found in his study. Guards stand at all the corners and a scribe quietly goes around the shelves, pulling scrolls and putting them back with equal earnest and disappointment. You're quickly waved in and just as quickly paid by the nobleman.%SPEECH_ON%Good job, sellsword. You're already a hero in some parts of these lands. Hell, maybe you'll end up in one of these scrolls, forever remembered.%SPEECH_OFF%You hear the scribe scoff. %employer% waves toward the door.%SPEECH_ON%Please? I've immense things to study, and so little time to do it.%SPEECH_OFF% | You enter %employer%'s room to find the man deep in his chair. Peasants argue on either side of him, pointing and accusing.%SPEECH_ON%This man is a murderer!%SPEECH_OFF%The defendant scoffs.%SPEECH_ON%Murderer? What happened was an accident! I thought he was one of them undead fellers!%SPEECH_OFF%The other man scoffs this time.%SPEECH_ON%Undead? He was merely drunk!%SPEECH_OFF%Tempers rise.%SPEECH_ON%Well, I heard growling! Or grunting.%SPEECH_OFF%Your employer despondently waves you in.%SPEECH_ON%Sellsword, good job on saving that town. Your pay.%SPEECH_OFF%He pushes a satchel of %reward_completion% crowns across the table. The peasants pause, staring at the coins wink out of its open top. You take the satchel, pretending that it weighs far too much for you.%SPEECH_ON%Oof, so heavy it is! You sirs have a good day.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% welcomes you into his room.%SPEECH_ON%My little birds tell me of the town being saved. You did well, mercenary, well enough in a world that's become so dark. Your pay of %reward_completion% crowns, as agreed upon.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% is standing outside, staring toward a graveyard that has gathered quite a few residents since your last visit. He hands you a satchel of %reward_completion% crowns.%SPEECH_ON%You did well, mercenary. Word of your doings has spread across the land. One success won't save us all, but it puts us on the right path. If we are to win this damned war with the dead, we need as much spirit and hope we can muster.%SPEECH_OFF%Taking your pay, you add that sellswords need as many crowns as possible. You know, to keep their 'spirits' high. The nobleman grins.%SPEECH_ON%I'm being sanctimonious, not philanthropic. Get on out of here.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer%'s guards take you into his room. He's got a few scrolls unwound all around him. Broken quill pens litter his table as though someone had splattered a bird there.%SPEECH_ON%Sellsword! Tis good to see the man of the hour, the day, the week! You did well in saving that town.%SPEECH_OFF%He throws you a satchel of %reward_completion% crowns.%SPEECH_ON%One victory to keep a town alive, one victory to keep the hopes of the people alive. I should pay you more. I mean, I won't, but I should.%SPEECH_OFF%You glumly take your pay, nodding back and responding.%SPEECH_ON%Well, it's the thought that counts.%SPEECH_OFF%The nobleman snaps his fingers.%SPEECH_ON%Exactly!%SPEECH_OFF% | You find %employer% slunk deep in his chair with an even deeper frown. His clothes wink with shiny opulence and the candelabras look worth more than the servants holding them. The gaudy grouch despondently waves you in. He speaks slowly and sarcastically.%SPEECH_ON%One victory for man. One more victory to carry us to the next day. Mmm, thank you sellsword.%SPEECH_OFF%You slowly step forward, the servants glancing at you with fearful eyes. You take your pay and step back. %employer% waves you away now.%SPEECH_ON%Begone.

    "translation": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_04.png[/img]{你进入%townname%，发现%employer%正从阳台上眺望。他刚向你打招呼，一个守卫就把一袋克朗塞进你怀里。%SPEECH_ON%佣兵！很高兴你回来了！我的小鸟们早已告知我你的成果。希望你把这些克朗花在刀刃上！%SPEECH_OFF%你还没来得及说什么，那人就转身离开了。递给你克朗的守卫也早已不见。农民们像绕开路标一样绕着你走，仿佛你指向的是他们永远不会去的地方。| 你发现%employer%正在对一个孩子拳打脚踢，最后一脚猛踹在胸口把他踢进了土里。看到你，贵族擦去额头的汗水，为自己解释道。%SPEECH_ON%不关你的事。%SPEECH_OFF%那孩子手脚并用撑在地上，一只手捂着肚子，另一只手擦拭着流血的鼻子。渐渐地，他站了起来，在那里摇晃着，视野模糊的眼睛眨出了血红色。一个仆人过来开始往他身上轻轻拍水，但贵族一把抓过布扔到一边。%SPEECH_ON%你以为那样他就能学乖吗？如果你想帮谁，就帮帮这位佣兵。他还等着拿%reward_completion%克朗。快去快去。%SPEECH_OFF%仆人点点头迅速离开。你待了一会儿，看着殴打继续。孩子没有哭喊，因为他对这种惩罚已经习以为常。几分钟后，仆人突然再次出现，手里拿着一个袋子。他把它交给你，并低声诚恳地建议你离开。 | %employer%俯身在他的桌子上，手臂僵硬地撑得又长又直，低着头凝视着一只死乌鸦。%SPEECH_ON%今天早上在我床上发现了这只乌鸦。就躺在那儿。死了。你知道这意味着什么吗？%SPEECH_OFF%你推测说，也许，是个玩笑。贵族嗤之以鼻。%SPEECH_ON%不。我认为这和你有关，佣兵。你拯救那个城镇做得很好，但也许它本不该被拯救？也许这就是这只鸟所代表的。也许死者接下来会来找我，因为我让死神欠收了。%SPEECH_OFF%你利用这句话慢慢将话题引到你自己的报酬问题上。尽管贵族胡言乱语了一通，但他还是暂时恢复了理智，支付了你%reward_completion%克朗。 | %employer%正在听一群书记员说话，这些人不知怎地按年龄和资历排列着。群体中的年轻人保持安静，他们发出的唯一声音是羽毛笔书写的沙沙声。长者们则互相争论，音量与理性和逻辑齐用。这似乎是当今常见的景象，毫无疑问，死者爬出坟墓哲学家来说是值得关注的事。无论如何，你大声打了个嗝来介绍自己，用令人厌恶的张扬打破了他们的谈话。%employer%大笑着招手让你进去。%SPEECH_ON%啊，佣兵！办实事的人，来和这些只会空谈的人聊聊？%SPEECH_OFF%你摇摇头告诉他你只是为了报酬而来。贵族点点头。%SPEECH_ON%当然。你救了那个镇子。我听到了很多关于你的英勇事迹。%reward_completion%克朗在角落等着你。%SPEECH_OFF%你走过房间，靴子在突然变得寂静的房间里发出皮革轻叩石地的声音。书记员们扭过头看着你，互相低声议论。你拿起一个袋子，听到克朗晃动发出的叮当声。你安静地离开，但就在门在你身后关上的那一刻，书记员们再次爆发出争论。 | %employer%身边跟着几个女人。她们正在向他诉说她们失去了父亲、丈夫和兄弟。他点着头，很专注，不过偶尔会抽空瞥一眼最年轻女孩的胸部。%SPEECH_ON%是，是，当然。太可怕了。可怕！稍等一下。佣兵！%SPEECH_OFF%他招手让你进去。你进去时女人们让开一条路。最年轻的姑娘上下打量着你，迅速擦去眼中的泪水，并稍微整理了一下仪容。贵族看到这个，目光在你和她之间扫了扫。%SPEECH_ON%嗯哼，是的，呃，你的克朗在角落。你必须走了。马上走。我还有事要处理。%SPEECH_OFF%他站起身指向你的%reward_completion%克朗，同时以一个迅速的动作拉住那位女士的手。%SPEECH_ON%那么，年轻的小娘子，你说你丈夫死了，在这世上再无依靠？完全没有任何人了？%SPEECH_OFF% | 几只狗在路上啃咬着什么东西。不管那是什么，它曾经拥有生命，骨骼和内脏早已变得苍白腐烂，不过这些杂种狗疯狂的吃相让人觉得那简直就是一块牛排。%employer%问候了你，身边跟着警觉的守卫。%SPEECH_ON%我的信使告诉我城镇得救了。你做得很好，佣兵，比我想象的还要好。你的报酬，按约定好的。%SPEECH_OFF%他递给你一袋%reward_completion%克朗。那些狗停了下来，把头转向你，牙齿上还晃荡着肉块，狭黑的眼睛映射着饥饿的空洞。守卫们放低了长矛，狗群似乎正确地理解了这一信号，慢慢地转回头继续享用它们的晚餐。 | %employer%深陷在他的椅子里。他沮丧地招手让你进房间。%SPEECH_ON%我有可怕的消息。我的预言师说我给我的土地和人民带来了诅咒。所以死者才会再次复活。%SPEECH_OFF%你耸耸肩，和善地说那个预言师满口胡言。贵族也耸耸肩。%SPEECH_ON%我当然希望如此。我们约定的是多少来着，%reward_completion%克朗？%SPEECH_OFF%你想说约定的是更多，但不敢得罪一个如此迷信的人。当你回答后，他对你准确的回答报以温暖的微笑。%SPEECH_ON%答得好，佣兵。你通过了测试。我可能的确要疯了，但我可不是好惹的。%SPEECH_OFF%你问你的诚实是否会得到奖励。那人挑了挑眉毛。%SPEECH_ON%你的脑袋还好好待在肩膀上，不是吗？%SPEECH_OFF%明白了。 | %employer%站在他的阳台上。你走到他身边，尽管守卫站得非常近，谨慎地打量着你。那人向他脚下的城镇挥了挥手。%SPEECH_ON%我知道你并非直接拯救了这个城镇，但在某种程度上，我认为你做到了。在任何地方阻止亡灵都等同于在这里阻止它们。你同意吗？%SPEECH_OFF%他用一袋%reward_completion%克朗为这个问题画上了句号。你接过报酬点了点头。他也点头回应。%SPEECH_ON%很高兴你同意，因为我们可能还需要你的服务。%SPEECH_OFF% | 你步入%employer%昏暗的房间。窗户上挂着毯子，大部分蜡烛都没有点亮。所有的光线都在一个手持枝形烛台站着的书记员身旁闪烁，他火红的脸让他酷似拿着三叉戟的小魔鬼。他瞥了你一眼，静静地放下蜡烛。当他后退时，仿佛坠入了一个黑色的水池，他那悬浮空中的脸慢慢沉入黑暗中。他还在那里，微微呼吸，斗篷沙沙作响，但你已看不到他的任何部分。%employer%招手让你进去。%SPEECH_ON%佣兵！旧神在上，你拯救了那个小镇！%SPEECH_OFF%你向前走去，瞥了一眼周围流动的黑暗，有些是阴影，有些是人。%employer%递给你一个袋子。敞开的袋口处，几枚被烛光照亮的钱币闪烁着微光。%SPEECH_ON%%reward_completion%克朗，之前商量好的。现在，请离开吧。我还有很多要研究，很多要学习。%SPEECH_OFF%你拿起报酬慢慢离开。当门关上时，你看到那个书记员如同一个憔悴的幽灵般重新浮现，骨瘦如柴的手再次伸向光亮。 | %employer%在他的书房里。守卫们站在各个角落，一个书记员安静地在书架间走动，抽出卷轴又放回去，带着同样的认真和失望。贵族一看到你招手让你上前，并快速地支付了报酬。%SPEECH_ON%干得好，佣兵。在这片土地的一些地方，你已经是个英雄了。见鬼，说不定你最终会写进这些卷轴，被永远铭记。%SPEECH_OFF%你听到书记员嗤笑一声。%employer%朝门挥了挥手。%SPEECH_ON%请吧？我有巨量的东西要研究，而时间却如此之少。%SPEECH_OFF% | 你进入%employer%的房间，发现他深陷在自己的椅子里。农民们在他两边争吵，互相指责。%SPEECH_ON%这个人是个杀人犯！%SPEECH_OFF%被告嗤之以鼻。%SPEECH_ON%杀人犯？当时只是个意外！我以为他是亡灵！%SPEECH_OFF%这次轮到另一个人嗤之以鼻了。%SPEECH_ON%亡灵？他不过是喝醉了！%SPEECH_OFF%双方脾气上来了。%SPEECH_ON%哼，我听到低吼了！或者是咕哝声。%SPEECH_OFF%你的雇主沮丧地招手让你进去。%SPEECH_ON%佣兵，干得好。你的报酬。%SPEECH_OFF%他把装有%reward_completion%克朗的袋子推过桌子。农民们停顿了一下，盯着敞开的袋口里闪烁的钱币。你拿起袋子，装作它太重的样子。%SPEECH_ON%嚯，可真重啊！先生们，祝你们有美好的一天。%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer%将你迎进他的房间。%SPEECH_ON%我的小鸟告诉我城镇得救了。你做得很好，佣兵，在这个变得如此黑暗的世界上，这已经很不错了。你的报酬%reward_completion%克朗，之前说好的。%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer%站在外面，凝视着一个自你上次来访后增添了不少居民的墓地。他递给你装有%reward_completion%克朗的钱袋。%SPEECH_ON%你做得很好，佣兵。你的事迹已经传遍了这片土地。一次成功拯救不了我们所有人，但它让我们走上了正确的道路。如果我们要打赢这场跟死人的战争，我们需要尽可能多的士气和希望。%SPEECH_OFF%接过报酬时，你补充说佣兵需要尽可能多的克朗。你知道，以保持他们的“士气”高涨。贵族咧嘴一笑。%SPEECH_ON%我这是道貌岸然，不是慈善慷慨。快给我出去。%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer%的守卫带你进入他的房间。他身边散落着几卷展开的卷轴。折断的羽毛笔乱扔在他的桌子上，仿佛有人在那里砸碎了一只鸟。%SPEECH_ON%佣兵！见到当下、今日、本周的风云人物真是太好了！你做得很好。%SPEECH_OFF%他扔给你装有%reward_completion%克朗的袋子。%SPEECH_ON%一次胜利让一个城镇存活，一次胜利让人民的希望存活。我应该付你更多。我的意思是，我不会，但我应该。%SPEECH_OFF%你闷闷不乐地接过报酬，点头回应。%SPEECH_ON%好吧，心意到了就行。%SPEECH_OFF%贵族打了个响指。%SPEECH_ON%正是！%SPEECH_OFF% | 你发现%employer%深陷在他的椅子里，眉头甚至皱得更深。他的衣服闪烁着奢华的光泽，枝形烛台看起来比举着它们的仆人还值钱。这个花哨的牢骚鬼沮丧地招手让你进去。他说话缓慢而充满讽刺。%SPEECH_ON%人类的一次胜利。让我们又能活到下一天。嗯，谢谢你，佣兵。%SPEECH_OFF%你慢慢走上前，仆人们用恐惧的眼神瞥着你。你拿起报酬向后退去。%employer%这时挥手让你离开。%SPEECH_ON%走吧。我希望再次见到你，除非你形容枯槁、变成死尸，那可就遗憾了。不过话说回来，我们最终不都是那个下场吗？%SPEECH_OFF%你什么也没说，离开了。看来对抗无尽亡灵的战争已经让这位贵族疲惫不堪了。}",

He calls to you just as a guard slams a satchel of crowns into your arms.%SPEECH_ON%Sellsword! So glas to have you back! My little birds have already told me much of your doings. I hope you spend those crowns well!%SPEECH_OFF%Before you can say anything, the man spins and leaves. The guard who handed you the crowns is already gone as well. Peasants walk around you like a signpost pointing to places they'll never go. | You find %employer% slapping and kicking a child around, eventually punting him into the dirt with swift boot to the chest. Seeing you, the nobleman wipes the sweat from his brow and explains himself.%SPEECH_ON%This doesn't concern you.%SPEECH_OFF%The kid is tilting on hands and knees, one hand to his belly, the other drawing blood from his leaking nose. Gradually, he gets to his feet, wavering there, blinkered eyes blinking crimson. A servant comes by and starts dabbing water over him, but the nobleman grabs the cloth and tosses it aside.%SPEECH_ON%You think he'll learn that way. If you want to help someone, help this sellsword. He is owed %reward_completion% crowns. Snap snap.%SPEECH_OFF%The servant nods and quickly leaves. You stay awhile, watching the beating continue. The kid doesn't cry or call out for there is learned expectation in this punishment. A few minutes pass when the servant suddenly reappears, satchel in hand. He hands it to you and whispers an earnest suggestion that you make your leave. | %employer% is stooped over his table, arms tented long and stiff, his head drooped low as he stares at a dead crow.%SPEECH_ON%Found this raven in my bed this morning. Just lying there. Dead. You've any idea what that means?%SPEECH_OFF%You suggest that it was, perhaps, a joke. The nobleman scoffs.%SPEECH_ON%Nay. I think this has to do with you, sellsword. You did well in saving that town, but perhaps it was not meant to be saved? Maybe that is what this bird represents. Maybe the dead shall come for me next as I have left Death itself unpaid.%SPEECH_OFF%You use this statement to slowly segue into the issue of your own pay. Despite his wild ravings, the nobleman does momentarily get his wits together to pay you your %reward_completion% crowns. | %employer% is listening to a group of scribes, somehow arranged in order of age and seniority. The youth of the group stay quiet, the only noise out of them is the scribbling of their quill pens. The elders argue amongst themselves, using volume just as much as reason and rationality. This seems a common sight nowadays, no doubt the dead climbing out of their graves being of some concern to men of philosophical takes. Regardless, you belch loudly to introduce yourself, shattering their conversation with disgusting aplomb. %employer% laughs and waves you in.%SPEECH_ON%Ah, sellsword! The man who gets things done, come to talk with the men who simply yap?%SPEECH_OFF%You shake your head and tell him you're only there for the pay. The nobleman nods.%SPEECH_ON%Of course. You did well in saving that town. I've heard much of your heroics. %reward_completion% crowns awaits you there in the corner.%SPEECH_OFF%You walk across the room, your boots filling the suddenly hollow room with quiet claps of leather on stone. The scribes twist to watch you, murmuring amongst themselves. You pick a satchel up, hearing the chink of crowns shift around with a most welcomed weight. You quietly leave, though the second the door closes behind you the scribes erupt with arguing once again. | %employer% is found with a few women beside him. They're telling him of their lost fathers, husbands, and brothers. He nods, attentively, though occasionally sparing a moment to glance at the bosom of the youngest girl.%SPEECH_ON%Yes, yes of course. Absolutely horrible. Horrible! Hold on one moment. Sellsword!%SPEECH_OFF%He waves you in. The women part as you make your entrance. The youngest gal looks you up and down, quickly wiping tears from her eyes and does a little bit of youthful primping. The nobleman sees this and glances between you and her.%SPEECH_ON%Ahem, yes, uh, your crowns are in the corner. You must go. Now. I've things to attend to.%SPEECH_OFF%He stands and points toward your %reward_completion% crowns, and in one swift motion takes the lady by the hand.%SPEECH_ON%Now, young backstress, you said your husband is dead and you've no one left in this life? Absolutely no one at all?%SPEECH_OFF% | Dogs chew up something in the path. Whatever it was, it once had life, bones and organs which have long since grown pale and rotten, though the mongrels rabid eating would suggest it might as well be a slab of steak. %employer% greets you, attentive guards at his side.%SPEECH_ON%My birds tell me the town was saved. You've done well, mercenary, better than I had thought you would. Your pay, as agreed upon.%SPEECH_OFF%He hands you a satchel of %reward_completion% crowns. The dogs pause, turning their heads toward you with flesh swinging from their teeth, narrow black eyes staring with an emptiness that reflects their hunger. The guards lower their spears and the dogs, somehow interpreting this correctly, slowly turn back to their dinner. | %employer% is found sitting low in his chair. He despondently waves you into the room.%SPEECH_ON%I've horrid news. My seer says I've brought a curse upon my land and my people. That's why the dead rise again.%SPEECH_OFF%You shrug and kindly state that the seer is full of shite. The nobleman shrugs.%SPEECH_ON%I sure hope so. What was it we agreed upon, %reward_completion% crowns?%SPEECH_OFF%You're tempted to say you agreed to more, but dare not cross a man who is so superstitious. When you answer, he smiles warmly at your accurate response.%SPEECH_ON%Good call, sellsword. You passed that test. I may be going mad, but I'm not one to trifle with.%SPEECH_OFF%You ask if your honesty will be rewarded. The man raises an eyebrow.%SPEECH_ON%Your head is on your shoulders, is it not?%SPEECH_OFF%Point taken. | %employer% is found on his balcony. You join him, though guards stand very nearby, eyeing you carefully. The man waves his arm to the town which lies beneath him.%SPEECH_ON%I know you did not save this town directly but, in a way, I think you did. Stopping the undead anywhere is as good as stopping them here. Would you agree?%SPEECH_OFF%The man punctuates the question with a satchel of %reward_completion% crowns. You take the pay and nod. He nods back.%SPEECH_ON%Glad you agree for we may yet need your services again.%SPEECH_OFF% | You step into %employer%'s darkened room. There are rugs over the windows and most of the candles are not lit. All the light flickers beside a scribe standing with a candelabra, his fire-red face grinning behind the candles like a little devil holding a trident. He glances at you and quietly sets the candles down. As he steps back, it is as though he were falling into a black pool, his disembodied face slowly dipping into the darkness. He's still there, breathing slightly, rustling his cloak, but you've naught a part of him to see. %employer% waves you in.%SPEECH_ON%Sellsword! By the old gods you did well in saving that town!%SPEECH_OFF%You step forward, glancing at the darkness which shifts around, some of it shadow, some of it man. %employer% hands you a satchel. A scattering of candlelit coins shimmer across its open top.%SPEECH_ON%%reward_completion% crowns, as agreed upon. Now, please, depart. I have to more to study, more to learn.%SPEECH_OFF%You take your pay and slowly leave. As the door closes, you see the scribe reemerge like a gaunt specter, bony hands reaching for the light once more. | %employer% is found in his study. Guards stand at all the corners and a scribe quietly goes around the shelves, pulling scrolls and putting them back with equal earnest and disappointment. You're quickly waved in and just as quickly paid by the nobleman.%SPEECH_ON%Good job, sellsword. You're already a hero in some parts of these lands. Hell, maybe you'll end up in one of these scrolls, forever remembered.%SPEECH_OFF%You hear the scribe scoff. %employer% waves toward the door.%SPEECH_ON%Please? I've immense things to study, and so little time to do it.%SPEECH_OFF% | You enter %employer%'s room to find the man deep in his chair. Peasants argue on either side of him, pointing and accusing.%SPEECH_ON%This man is a murderer!%SPEECH_OFF%The defendant scoffs.%SPEECH_ON%Murderer? What happened was an accident! I thought he was one of them undead fellers!%SPEECH_OFF%The other man scoffs this time.%SPEECH_ON%Undead? He was merely drunk!%SPEECH_OFF%Tempers rise.%SPEECH_ON%Well, I heard growling! Or grunting.%SPEECH_OFF%Your employer despondently waves you in.%SPEECH_ON%Sellsword, good job on saving that town. Your pay.%SPEECH_OFF%He pushes a satchel of %reward_completion% crowns across the table. The peasants pause, staring at the coins wink out of its open top. You take the satchel, pretending that it weighs far too much for you.%SPEECH_ON%Oof, so heavy it is! You sirs have a good day.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% welcomes you into his room.%SPEECH_ON%My little birds tell me of the town being saved. You did well, mercenary, well enough in a world that's become so dark. Your pay of %reward_completion% crowns, as agreed upon.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% is standing outside, staring toward a graveyard that has gathered quite a few residents since your last visit. He hands you a satchel of %reward_completion% crowns.%SPEECH_ON%You did well, mercenary. Word of your doings has spread across the land. One success won't save us all, but it puts us on the right path. If we are to win this damned war with the dead, we need as much spirit and hope we can muster.%SPEECH_OFF%Taking your pay, you add that sellswords need as many crowns as possible. You know, to keep their 'spirits' high. The nobleman grins.%SPEECH_ON%I'm being sanctimonious, not philanthropic. Get on out of here.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer%'s guards take you into his room. He's got a few scrolls unwound all around him. Broken quill pens litter his table as though someone had splattered a bird there.%SPEECH_ON%Sellsword! Tis good to see the man of the hour, the day, the week! You did well in saving that town.%SPEECH_OFF%He throws you a satchel of %reward_completion% crowns.%SPEECH_ON%One victory to keep a town alive, one victory to keep the hopes of the people alive. I should pay you more. I mean, I won't, but I should.%SPEECH_OFF%You glumly take your pay, nodding back and responding.%SPEECH_ON%Well, it's the thought that counts.%SPEECH_OFF%The nobleman snaps his fingers.%SPEECH_ON%Exactly!%SPEECH_OFF% | You find %employer% slunk deep in his chair with an even deeper frown. His clothes wink with shiny opulence and the candelabras look worth more than the servants holding them. The gaudy grouch despondently waves you in. He speaks slowly and sarcastically.%SPEECH_ON%One victory for man. One more victory to carry us to the next day. Mmm, thank you sellsword.%SPEECH_OFF%You slowly step forward, the servants glancing at you with fearful eyes. You take your pay and step back. %employer% waves you away now.%SPEECH_ON%Begone. I hope to see you again, lest you are of ill-shape and of dead body, then it would be a shame. Then again, that's how we're all going to end up, isn't it?%SPEECH_OFF%You say nothing and make your leave. It appears the war against the unending undead has worn on the nobleman.}\""
