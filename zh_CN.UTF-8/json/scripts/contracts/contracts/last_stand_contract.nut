    "original": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_46.png[/img]{You stare over the battlefield. It is littered with the dead, the dying, the undying, and the dying undying. Men, of the living, breathing sort, march about the muck, finishing off anything that remotely resembles a reanimation. With the fight over, and the town saved, %employer% should now be expecting you. | The battle is over and the town saved. Time to return %employer% for a hell of a payday. | %objective% resembles a flooded graveyard more than any town you know of. Corpses, new and old, are washed out across the earth, blood and molded filth pooled about each. The stench reminds you of a dead dog you found alongside a creek, bones dripping the decomposition, the body being fed upon by crawfish and maggots.\n\nThe relentless attacks having finally ceased, %objective% seems safe for now. %employer% should be expecting you and you've no reason to not escape this horrid place as soon as possible. | Well, the town is saved. The peasants step about the battlefield with long sticks, poking the earth like pelicans prodding over a pool of most dangerous waters. %randombrother% comes over, cleaning the sludge off his blade, and asks if it is time to return to %employer%. You nod. The sooner you can get back for your pay the better. | The battle is over. Among the dead are peasants and militiamen, each attended by survivors who've come to cloak the bodies with sobbing silhouettes. As for the dead undead, well, nobody cares. Those bodies lay as though they came with no purpose and yet departed with a thorough destruction of whatever they touched. The sight of their corpses, and the chaotic nothingness that they represent, is infuriating. Not wanting to be around a second longer, you inform the men to get ready to return to %employer%. | You and the %companyname% stand victorious. The town and its people will survive, for now, and you can return to %employer% for your pay. | The lieutenant of the guard thanks you for saving the town. You mention that the only reason you're here is because someone paid you. He shrugs.%SPEECH_ON%I thank the rains I've no command over, I'll thank you mercenary whether you like it or not.%SPEECH_OFF% | The battle is over and, thankfully, won. Undead bodies spill over the earth in such disarray that they hardly look any different than they did shambling and shuffling just hours ago. But the more recently expired share no such cosmic despondence. They are attended to by wailing women and confused children. You look away from the scene, ordering the %companyname% to prepare its return to %employer%. | A dead man is at your feet, and beside him an undead corpse. It's the strangest of sights, for they are equally put out of this world, but there's life yet in the man. The breath of a recent memory. You saw him swinging to the very end. A noble way for a fighter to go. This corpse, though? What of it? You'll remember it tearing a man's throat out with its bare teeth. Maybe the corpse had a time beyond that moment, a time when it had a family, a time when it was but a kind man doing good in this world. But a throat-ripping monstrosity is all it is now. All it will be remembered as.\n\nThe relentless attacks on %objective% have finally ceased, and so you hurry to collect the company and prepare a return to %employer% in %townname%. A good payday is better than another moment of looking at this shite. | What is a dead man? What of a dead man killed twice over? And what of a dead man killed thrice over? Unfortunate. Misfortunate. And a joke.\n\n You walk the battlefield collecting the men of the %companyname%. The town of %objective% is saved for now, and so it's time for you to get back to %employer% in %townname% for a well-earned payday. | %randombrother% wipes his forehead with a cloth, leaving behind a disgusting smear of pale liquid.%SPEECH_ON%Shite, what is that? Is that brain? Sir, would you please?%SPEECH_OFF%You help the man clean himself off. He stands back, arms wide. He's still absolutely covered in blood, guts, and things which may forever be left unknown.%SPEECH_ON%How do I look?%SPEECH_OFF%His grin winks out of the murk like a rind of the moon through a pale sky. You refuse to answer and just tell him to go get the men. With %objective% saved for now, %employer% will be expecting the company back in %townname%, and the company should be expecting a well-earned payday. | %randombrother% comes to your side, together the two of you overlooking the battlefield. Already you can see the families of the dead coming out to find their lost ones. Their wailing is sharp, humanly pitched, a disturbingly welcomed respite from the growling, moaning despondence of the undead. The mercenary claps you on the shoulder.%SPEECH_ON%I'll go and collect the men so we can get on back to %townname% and collect our pay.%SPEECH_OFF% | You watch as women shuffle about the battlefield, holding their dresses up like wetted fowl steering clear of a pond's murk. Of course, once they find what they're looking for, they drop all regard for cleanliness and drop into the filth, wailing and howling, covering themselves in the very horrors which had dispatched their fathers and husbands with infuriating indifference.\n\n %randombrother% joins your side.%SPEECH_ON%Sir, the attacks have ceased and the men are ready to return to %townname%. Just give the word.%SPEECH_OFF% | The lieutenant of the guard comes to your side and shakes your hand. Drying blood cracks and crumbles as you shake. He puts his fists to his hips and nods at the scene.%SPEECH_ON%You did well, sellsword, and we could not have done it without you. I'd like to offer you more as thanks, but this town needs all the resources it has to rebuild. I do hope that %employer% pays you all that you are worth.%SPEECH_OFF%You hope so, too.}",

Apparently, your awkward trip through to their front gate was of at least some amusement. | Bumbling and trundling as they are, the %companyname% finally passes through the front gate. Inside, the guards are standing with amused despondence, looking like they just stepped out of a horrific battle to be witnesses to a strange joke. One claps you on the shoulder.%SPEECH_ON%That was awfully funny to watch, mercenary, and my men needed the lift. Thank you.%SPEECH_OFF% | Taking a look around, you see the guards are frail, bony men standing watch over townspeople who look almost half-dead already. The muddied roads are littered with shite, garbage, and animal carcasses. Women and children weep at a makeshift graveyard: a ditch with a scroll of names penned above it, ink freshly renewed for another addition. | You enter through the gates of %objective% and find a few guards standing guard with thin hands tented atop spears. Their clothes shift about their bones like curtains astride an open window. The sense of hunger lingers thick in the air, reflected in the lip-smacking stares you're getting for just being here in good health. One of the defenders greets you warmly enough.%SPEECH_ON%We're tired and a wee bit hungry, but we'll manage. The fight is still in us, don't you doubt that.%SPEECH_OFF% | When you enter through the gates of %objective%, a dog is the first to greet you, licking your legs and sniffing deeply up your trousers. A man suddenly comes hollering, club raised, and soon man and animal go skittering down the muddied road, both seemingly barking. The mutt dodges the slow tackles of a hungry crowd and disappears entirely. A grinning guard walks over, using a stick to balance himself.%SPEECH_ON%Evenin', sellsword. Food stocks are a bit low and that there doggo is fair game in a land of empty bellies.%SPEECH_OFF%You ask if they can still fight and the man laughs.%SPEECH_ON%Hell, a fight's all we got left!%SPEECH_OFF% | Entering through the front gates of %objective% is like walking beyond the veils of normalcy into the pits of the hells. Villagers shamble about, nothing to do but go hungrier and hungrier, and guards share jokes like they would food, laughing painfully while clutching their stomachs. The head of the defense comes over. He's unshaven, scarred, slackjawed, eyes looking labored with labored lookin'. Although he stands a foot away, it's like he's staring at you from another world.%SPEECH_ON%Glad you made it, sellsword. We could certainly use your help these days.%SPEECH_OFF% | You pass through the gates of %objective% to find hell itself awaiting you. Guards stand at the ready like skeletons propped by a madman, and the villagers stand idle or lying in the dirt or leaning face-first against the walls. Children stand atop thatched roofs and pick through the straw in search of bugs. The defense's lieutenant welcomes you bluntly.%SPEECH_ON%Thank ye for comin' sellsword, but you should have stayed home.%SPEECH_OFF% | The front gates of %objective% lurch ajar and slowly wheel open as the doorhandlers struggle to push the mechanisms forward. You enter the town to find a bunch of sextons digging a massive ditch right off the path. They're dumping bodies in and preparing fires to burn the corpses. The defense's lieutenant walks over.%SPEECH_ON%Sometimes the dead come back, but we learned ashes don't. Well, maybe they do, but they ain't no harm to nobody.%SPEECH_OFF%You think to mention the horrid stench, but realize that they probably got used to it ages ago. | Beyond the cluttered gates of %objective% you find a town that might as well have already succumbed to the undead hordes. Villagers shuffle around aimless and despondent. A few guardsmen stand beside a wagon going from home to home, giving out rations. You see a few defenders asleep along the fortifications walls, arms half strung along the crenelations and gripping their weapons, looking like puppets thrown in a corner. The lieutenant of the defense comes over.%SPEECH_ON%Thank you for comin', sellsword. Many of us didn't think you would on account of this being hell itself.%SPEECH_OFF% | The front gates to %objective% are opened up and you pass through. Inside, you find two guards dragging a corpse toward a burning pile of bodies. A woman clutches at the boots of the dead man, begging them to let her have one last look. They ignore her and heave it into the fire and she falls before the pyre, slumping over as the skin of her husband crackles and pops. The defense's lieutenant comes over.

Your swords are most appreciated mercenary and, make no mistake, you'll be using them shortly.%SPEECH_OFF% | You step through the gates of %objective% and are met with the smell of burnt flesh.

The dead, they come back, and we is a suffering town. This here pile was a family. The wife died in the night and, through the cover of darkness, ate and ate and ate. We burn all the bodies.

He straightens the kid's back and orders him to breathe deep before shooting. The amateur archer nods and does as told. The arrow is loosed. It wobbles, caroms off the ground, and rattles spinning into a stable where a few horses whinny at the scary disturbance. The nobleman claps the boy on the back.%SPEECH_ON%Trust me, I was worse on my first go. Keep at it. I'll be back in a moment.%SPEECH_OFF%The nobleman approaches you, shaking his head and lowering his voice.%SPEECH_ON%Things are dire, mercenary. The young know not of what dangers lurk these days, but you do. We have a settlement, %objective% just %direction% of here, that is surrounded by... well, the ills of this world.

I've not a man to spare, but if you go there and help this town then you will be rewarded most handsomely!%SPEECH_OFF% | You find %employer% sitting between an abbot and a scribe who are yelling at each other in jowl-shaking, teeth-rattling old man voices. Given that the dead are arisen, questions of both mortality and life-after-death have become rather furiously debated. The nobleman sees you and jumps to his feet. He hurries to you, the argument raging in the background.%SPEECH_ON%Thank the old gods you are here, mercenary. Just %direction% of here, %objective% is under siege by an army of horribles. Undead, foul things, I don't know, I just know I don't have the men to protect the town myself. Go there and ensure those people are safe and I will pay you well!%SPEECH_OFF% | You find %employer% overseeing a group of sextons lowering a casket into the ground. The coffin is firmly nailed shut, almost hurriedly so: nails corkscrew and bend off the wood, and there are scrape marks along the sides. Seeing you, the nobleman comes over.%SPEECH_ON%The resident of said box decided to come back out. Killed a child and a dog. Almost killed another before the guards put it back down.%SPEECH_OFF%A splurge of black liquid gushes from the bottom of the coffin. The gravediggers jump away, dropping the crate right into its grave with a heavy clatter. %employer% shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%With all these 'undead' outbreaks, my forces have been spread thin.

He's shaking his head, every twist of the neck seemingly turning another page. Upset, he hurriedly waves you in.%SPEECH_ON%Don't dally, sellsword, we've no time for that. I need you to go to %objective% %direction% of here. My birds tell me it's under assault, more of these damned 'dead' come to life, if that's really the way to say it. Are you interested in going? The pay will more than compensate your efforts.%SPEECH_OFF% | You find %employer% watching over some masons putting sharply cut stones together. He shakes your hand.%SPEECH_ON%Building another monastery, sellsword, how does it look?%SPEECH_OFF%It looks good, but you point out that there is another abbey right across the road. The nobleman smirks.%SPEECH_ON%The dead are walking the earth again, there ain't enough pews around to sit the scared folk. Listen, I called you here because my forces are spread thin trying to handle this... oddity of undeath. There's a town just %direction% of here, %objective%, that desperately needs help. My birds tell me it's under attack and you seem just the man who'd be interested in saving it. For a price, of course.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer%, a treasurer, and a commander are talking. The treasurer says there's plenty of crowns, but the commander bluntly states that there are no men around with which to pay to fight. You, like the devil you are, enter the room and are immediately spoken of.%SPEECH_ON%Sellsword! Your services are needed immediately! We have a village %direction% of here, a little place called %objective%, that is under attack by these, er, what are they?%SPEECH_OFF%The commander leans toward the nobleman and whispers the answer.

Messengers told me that it is under attack by some unbelievable force, undead to be exact. Yes, that unbelievable. Whatever assails their walls, I have not the men to handle it. But you, sellsword, your services would be most appropriate here. Would you be interested?%SPEECH_OFF% | You find %employer% and a gaunt scribe staring at a headless corpse laid across a slab of stone. The head is in a corner, the eyeballs slanted, steel rods standing out of its half-carved skull. Seeing you, the nobleman offers an inviting hand.%SPEECH_ON%Nothing to fear, sellsword. As I'm sure you've heard, the dead are walking the earth again and with that comes a great deal of speculation as to why.%SPEECH_OFF%The scribe looks up, interrupting.%SPEECH_ON%Or how...%SPEECH_OFF%Smiling, the nobleman continues.%SPEECH_ON%Anyway, %objective% %direction% of here is being assaulted by these very monsters, er, former humans? But I've not the men to send relief. You, however, are perfect for the job. Would you be willing to take it?%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% is listening to the whispers of a scribe when you enter his room. The scribe glances at you with jaundiced eyes before continuing his talk. When he finishes, both men nod and the elder leaves. He doesn't so much as look at you as he goes. %employer% calls out.%SPEECH_ON%Glad you are here, sellsword! These are indeed dire times. My men are spread across the land handling all manner of monstrous evils. I'm sure you have heard already, but the 'dead', or whatever they are, walk again. And they're assaulting %objective% %direction% of here. With no men to spare, I depend upon your services, sellsword. Would you help save this town?%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% is listening to the pleas of a group of peasants. You've only arrived for the tail-end of the conversation as the nobleman angrily waves them off. As the laymen shout, guards close ranks to escort them out, peacefully for now, violently if they so wish. They go out the door without further protests, though one peasant glances at you and mouths 'help us' before turning away. %employer% waves his hand.%SPEECH_ON%Well, hell, if it isn't the sellsword! Right on time, my money-grubbing friend. I've a town %direction% of here, %objective%, which is in dire need of help. It is currently, so they say anyway, under siege by the undead.

Seeing you, the nobleman wipes the sweat from his brow and explains himself.%SPEECH_ON%This doesn't concern you.%SPEECH_OFF%The kid is tilting on hands and knees, one hand to his belly, the other drawing blood from his leaking nose. Gradually, he gets to his feet, wavering there, blinkered eyes blinking crimson. A servant comes by and starts dabbing water over him, but the nobleman grabs the cloth and tosses it aside.%SPEECH_ON%You think he'll learn that way. If you want to help someone, help this sellsword. He is owed %reward_completion% crowns. Snap snap.%SPEECH_OFF%The servant nods and quickly leaves. You stay awhile, watching the beating continue.

Maybe the dead shall come for me next as I have left Death itself unpaid.%SPEECH_OFF%You use this statement to slowly segue into the issue of your own pay. Despite his wild ravings, the nobleman does momentarily get his wits together to pay you your %reward_completion% crowns. | %employer% is listening to a group of scribes, somehow arranged in order of age and seniority. The youth of the group stay quiet, the only noise out of them is the scribbling of their quill pens. The elders argue amongst themselves, using volume just as much as reason and rationality. This seems a common sight nowadays, no doubt the dead climbing out of their graves being of some concern to men of philosophical takes. Regardless, you belch loudly to introduce yourself, shattering their conversation with disgusting aplomb. %employer% laughs and waves you in.%SPEECH_ON%Ah, sellsword!

You quietly leave, though the second the door closes behind you the scribes erupt with arguing once again. | %employer% is found with a few women beside him. They're telling him of their lost fathers, husbands, and brothers. He nods, attentively, though occasionally sparing a moment to glance at the bosom of the youngest girl.%SPEECH_ON%Yes, yes of course. Absolutely horrible. Horrible! Hold on one moment. Sellsword!%SPEECH_OFF%He waves you in. The women part as you make your entrance. The youngest gal looks you up and down, quickly wiping tears from her eyes and does a little bit of youthful primping.

I've things to attend to.%SPEECH_OFF%He stands and points toward your %reward_completion% crowns, and in one swift motion takes the lady by the hand.%SPEECH_ON%Now, young backstress, you said your husband is dead and you've no one left in this life?

You've done well, mercenary, better than I had thought you would. Your pay, as agreed upon.%SPEECH_OFF%He hands you a satchel of %reward_completion% crowns.

You join him, though guards stand very nearby, eyeing you carefully. The man waves his arm to the town which lies beneath him.%SPEECH_ON%I know you did not save this town directly but, in a way, I think you did.

You're quickly waved in and just as quickly paid by the nobleman.%SPEECH_ON%Good job, sellsword. You're already a hero in some parts of these lands. Hell, maybe you'll end up in one of these scrolls, forever remembered.%SPEECH_OFF%You hear the scribe scoff. %employer% waves toward the door.%SPEECH_ON%Please?

You sirs have a good day.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% welcomes you into his room.%SPEECH_ON%My little birds tell me of the town being saved. You did well, mercenary, well enough in a world that's become so dark. Your pay of %reward_completion% crowns, as agreed upon.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% is standing outside, staring toward a graveyard that has gathered quite a few residents since your last visit. He hands you a satchel of %reward_completion% crowns.%SPEECH_ON%You did well, mercenary. Word of your doings has spread across the land. One success won't save us all, but it puts us on the right path. If we are to win this damned war with the dead, we need as much spirit and hope we can muster.%SPEECH_OFF%Taking your pay, you add that sellswords need as many crowns as possible. You know, to keep their 'spirits' high. The nobleman grins.%SPEECH_ON%I'm being sanctimonious, not philanthropic. Get on out of here.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer%'s guards take you into his room. He's got a few scrolls unwound all around him. Broken quill pens litter his table as though someone had splattered a bird there.%SPEECH_ON%Sellsword!

You did well in saving that town.%SPEECH_OFF%He throws you a satchel of %reward_completion% crowns.%SPEECH_ON%One victory to keep a town alive, one victory to keep the hopes of the people alive.

    "translation": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_04.png[/img]{你来到了%townname%，发现%employer%正在阳台上观望。就在卫兵把一袋克朗狠狠地扔进你怀中之际，他朝你喊道：%SPEECH_ON%雇佣兵！太高兴见到你回来了！我的小鸟们已经告诉我了你的种种行迹，希望你好好花这些克朗！%SPEECH_OFF%还没等你回答，那个人就转身走了。递给你克朗的卫兵也已经不见了踪影。农民们在你身边走过，像是指向他们永远走不到的地方的路标。} | 你发现%employer%正在毒打一个孩子，最终用脚迅速踢向孩子的胸部，将他踢倒在地。看到你，贵族从额头上擦去汗水并解释了自己。%SPEECH_ON%这不关你的事。%SPEECH_OFF%孩子跪在地上，一只手按在肚子上，另一只手的鼻孔里流着血。逐渐地，他站起来，双眼发红地晃动。一名仆人过来给他擦水，但贵族抢过抹布扔到了一边。%SPEECH_ON%你觉得这样可以让他学习。如果你想帮助别人，就帮助这个雇佣军。他被欠下了%reward_completion%克朗的报酬。快点。%SPEECH_OFF%仆人点了点头，赶紧离开了。你待了一会，看着孩子被打。孩子没有哭也没有喊叫，因为他早已经习惯了这种惩罚。几分钟后，仆人突然出现了，手里拿着一个袋子。他把它递给你并悄悄地建议你离开。 | %employer%弯腰俯身在桌子上，双臂僵硬，头低垂着，盯着一只死乌鸦。%SPEECH_ON%我今天早上在我的床上找到了这只乌鸦。就在那躺着。死了。你有什么想法吗？%SPEECH_OFF% 你建议这可能只是一个玩笑。贵族嗤之以鼻。%SPEECH_ON%不。我认为这与你有关，佣兵。你在拯救那个城镇时表现得很出色，但也许它本不该被拯救？也许这就是这只鸟代表的意思。也许死亡会因为我没有偿还而下一步会找上门来。%SPEECH_OFF% 你利用这个声明缓缓地转入到自己的工资问题。尽管贵族说了一些胡话，但他还是清醒地支付了你%reward_completion%克朗。 | %employer% 正在听一群文书的讨论，他们按年龄和资历排成了一定的次序。年轻人保持沉默，只听到他们的鹅毛笔划过纸张的声音。老年人们则在彼此争吵，使用高声与道理来说服对方。这看起来如今是常见的场景，毫无疑问，死人从坟墓中爬起来对于哲学思考的人们来说是一个不同寻常的关注点。无论如何，你大声打了个嗝介绍自己，恶心地打乱了他们的谈话。%employer% 笑着向你挥手让你进来。%SPEECH_ON%啊，雇佣兵！一个能成事的人，来与那些只会喋喋不休的人交谈？%SPEECH_OFF%你摇了摇头，告诉他你只是为了报酬而来。贵族点点头。%SPEECH_ON%当然。你在拯救那个城镇时干得很好。我听到了许多你的英勇事迹。%reward_completion% 就在那角落里等待着你的克朗。%SPEECH_OFF%你穿过房间，皮靴轻轻拍打着石头地面发出微弱的声音。文书们扭头看着你，互相窃窃私语。你拿起一个包，听到克朗的钱币发出了一声清脆的响声，也感到了一丝温暖的重量。你悄悄地离开了，然而当门在你背后关闭时，文书们再次开始争吵。 | %employer% 身边站着几个女人，她们在告诉他她们失去的父亲、丈夫和兄弟。他认真地点头，偶尔会分神看一眼最年轻的女孩的胸部。%SPEECH_ON%是的，当然。非常可怕。可怕啊！等一下,雇佣兵！%SPEECH_OFF%他向你招手让你进来。女人们在你走进来时分开，最年轻的姑娘看了你一眼，迅速擦去眼泪，并做了一些青春期的整理。贵族看到这一幕，扫了你和她一眼。%SPEECH_ON%咳咳，你们的克朗在角落里。你必须走了。现在我有事情要处理。%SPEECH_OFF%他站起身，指向你的%reward_completion%克朗，然后一下子拉起了那位女士的手。%SPEECH_ON%现在，年轻的女裁缝，你说你的丈夫已故，这辈子一个人也没有了？绝对没有任何亲人了吗？%SPEECH_OFF% | 路上的狗啃了点东西。无论它曾经是什么，它曾经有生命，骨头和器官早已变得苍白和腐烂，尽管这些杂种狗狂暴的进食似乎就像吃了一块牛排。%employer%在他的注意力集中的卫兵身边向你问候。%SPEECH_ON%我的鸟儿告诉我城镇得救了。你做得很好，佣兵，比我想象的要好。你的酬劳，按照约定。%SPEECH_OFF%他递给你一个装有%reward_completion% 克朗的小包。狗们暂停了，转过头，嘴里的肉摇晃着，狭黑的眼睛里闪烁着饥饿的空虚。卫兵们放下了长矛，狗们则慢慢地回头继续吃他们的晚餐。 | %employer%低头坐在椅子里。他沮丧地挥手示意你进入房间。%SPEECH_ON%我有一个可怕的消息。我的先知说我给我的土地和人民带来了诅咒。这就是为什么死者会再次复活的原因。%SPEECH_OFF%你耸耸肩，友好地表示先知所说的是胡说八道。贵族耸了耸肩。%SPEECH_ON%我真的希望是这样。我们达成了什么协议，%reward_completion% 克朗？%SPEECH_OFF%你想说你们达成了更多的协议，但不敢得罪一个如此迷信的人。当你回答时，他热情地对你的准确回答微笑。%SPEECH_ON%干得好，雇佣兵。你通过了那个考验。我可能快疯了，但我不会轻易对付。%SPEECH_OFF%你问自己的诚实是否会得到回报。这个人扬起了一只眉毛。%SPEECH_ON%你的头还在自己的肩膀上，不是吗？%SPEECH_OFF%意见已被接受。 | %employer%(雇主)在他的阳台上被发现。尽管守卫们严密地注视着你，但你还是加入了他。这个人挥动他的手臂指向了他所在的城镇.%SPEECH_ON%我知道你没有直接拯救这个城镇，但在某种程度上，我认为你做到了。在任何地方阻止不死族的行动都和在这里阻止一样好。你同意吗？%SPEECH_OFF%这个人给了你%reward_completion%克朗的报酬。你接受了报酬并点了点头。他也点头示意。%SPEECH_ON%你同意了，我很高兴，因为我们可能还需要你的服务。%SPEECH_OFF% | 你踏入雇主微光的房间。窗户上挂着地毯，大部分的蜡烛都没有点燃。在一个拿着烛台的抄写员旁边的所有灯光闪烁着，他火红的脸庞在烛光下宛如握着三叉戟的小恶魔。他朝你瞥了一眼，静静地放下蜡烛。当他退后时，就像他跌入了黑色的池中，他的无躯之躯慢慢沉入黑暗之中。他还在那里，微微呼吸，衣服沙沙作响，但你已经无法看到他的一部分了。%employer%招手让你进去。%SPEECH_ON%雇佣兵！老神在上，你拯救了那个城镇。%SPEECH_OFF%你向前走去，扫了一眼周围摇曳的黑暗，有些是阴影，有些是人。%employer%递给你一个包裹。一些点燃的硬币在其开口处闪烁着。%SPEECH_ON%完成奖励%crowns，如协议所述。现在，请出发吧。我还有更多要研究，要学习的。%SPEECH_OFF%你拿起你的报酬缓慢离开。当门关闭时，你看到抄写员再次出现，像一个憔悴的幽灵，骨瘦如柴的手再次伸向烛光。 | %employer%在他的书房里。守卫们站立在角落里，一位写字员悄悄地绕着书架转，带着同样的热情和失望拉出卷轴，并将它们放回原处。你很快被贵族招手进去，又很快被付款。%SPEECH_ON%干得好，雇佣兵。在这片土地上，你已经成为一位英雄了。说不定，你最终会被记录在这些卷轴之一，永远为人所记忆。%SPEECH_OFF%你听到写字员咕哝着，%employer%朝着门挥了挥手。%SPEECH_ON%请出去吧？我有许多重要的事情要研究，时间太短了。%SPEECH_OFF% | 你进入%employer%的房间，发现他深深地坐在椅子里。农民们在他两边争论不休，指责对方。%SPEECH_ON%这个人是个杀人犯！%SPEECH_OFF%被告翻了个白眼。%SPEECH_ON%杀人犯？那只是一个意外！我以为他是不死族！%SPEECH_OFF%另一个人也翻了个白眼。%SPEECH_ON%不死族？他只是喝醉了！%SPEECH_OFF%情绪开始升高。%SPEECH_ON%噢，我听见他叫嚣！或者呻吟。%SPEECH_OFF%你的雇主绝望地向你挥手示意。%SPEECH_ON%佣兵，你救了那个城镇，干得好。这是你的报酬。%SPEECH_OFF%他将一个装满%reward_completion%克朗的袋子顶上桌子。农民们都停止说话，盯着硬币从袋子的开口中滴落。你拿起这个袋子，假装它对你来说太重了。%SPEECH_ON%哦，太重了！你们先生们有个好天！%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer%欢迎你来到他的房间。%SPEECH_ON%我的耳目告诉我，城镇得救了。你干得很好，雇佣兵，在这个变得如此黑暗的世界中干得很好。按照协议支付你%reward_completion%克朗的报酬。%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer%站在外面，朝着一个墓地凝视，自从你上次来访后，这里的居民已经明显增多了。他递给你一个装着%reward_completion%克朗的小包。%SPEECH_ON%干得好，佣兵。你的事迹已经传遍了这片土地。一次胜利不能拯救我们所有人，但它把我们带上了正确的道路。如果我们要赢得这场与亡者的可恶之战，我们需要尽可能多的精神和希望。%SPEECH_OFF%你拿起报酬，补充道雇佣兵需要尽可能多的克朗，你知道，为了保持士气高昂。贵族笑了。%SPEECH_ON%我的话没有出自慈善，而是表现得正义凛然。出去吧。%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer%的守卫带你进他的房间。他周围展开了一些卷轴。破碎的羽毛笔散落在他的桌子上，就像有人在那里溅了一只鸟。%SPEECH_ON%雇佣兵！很高兴见到这场战争的胜利者，这场星期的胜利者！你解救了那个镇子，干得好！%SPEECH_OFF%他扔给你一个装着%reward_completion%克朗的小包。%SPEECH_ON%为了保住一座城镇的生命，为了保持人民希望的生命，这是一次胜利。我应该多付你一些报酬。我的意思是，我不会多付你，但我应该多付你。%SPEECH_OFF%你黯然接受你的薪酬，点点头回复。%SPEECH_ON%哦，重要的是心意。%SPEECH_OFF%贵族响起手指。%SPEECH_ON%没错！%SPEECH_OFF% | 你发现%employer%深深地坐在椅子里，脸上带着更深的皱纹。他的衣服闪烁着耀眼的富丽和华丽，烛台看起来比拿着它们的仆人更值钱。这个花哨的怨妇沮丧地向你挥手示意。他慢慢地、带着嘲讽的口吻说道。%SPEECH_ON%人类的一个胜利。再一个胜利，这将支撑我们到明天。嗯，谢谢你，佣兵。%SPEECH_OFF%你慢慢地向前迈步，仆人们带着恐惧的眼神瞥了你一眼。你拿到了你的薪水，然后退了回去。%employer%现在示意你离开。%SPEECH_ON%走吧。我希望再次见到你，除非你身体不好，已经死了，那将是一件耻辱的事情。但再想想，我们最终都会这样结束，不是吗？%SPEECH_OFF%你什么话也没说，离开了。这场对抗不死族的战争已经让这个贵族疲惫不堪。",
