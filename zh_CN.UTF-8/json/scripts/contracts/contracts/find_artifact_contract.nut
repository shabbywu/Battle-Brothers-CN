He gives you a sack of %reward_completion% crowns.%SPEECH_ON%Good job, sellsword, but you should go. This isn't your crowd. Not that it is mine, either.%SPEECH_OFF%He winks and shoos you off. | A scribe intercepts you outside %employer%'s room.

I'm sure you understand.%SPEECH_OFF%Over the nobleman's shoulders you see the boy assassinating another plant. You slowly nod. | You hand the relic over to %employer%.

I have identified an artifact of great power located %direction% of here in a place called '%objective%'. I believe this artifact may contain the power to help resolve this issue with the dead... coming alive again. I also believe that power of this magnitude does not go unnoticed in this world. You need to go there, fight off anyone who thinks it belongs to them, and return to us. | Welcome, sellsword. It is not often I go to a man of your vocation to solve my problems. A good book and a quiet evening used to more than suffice, but no longer. We need you to travel %direction% of here to a place called '%objective%'. We have reason to believe it may contain the answer to our problem of the dead walking among us. Of course, such power is a powerful lure. You need to move fast to get there and back, lest we may lose it.}%SPEECH_OFF% | A scribe stands at %employer%'s side. Both men are staring at a piece of paper. As you near, they slowly push it across the table for you to read. It appears that the scribe has located a place of immense power and they believe it may contain the solution to the undead scourge. %employer% believes many others will be hunting for it, too, and that speed is of the utmost importance. | You find %employer% talking to a scribe, both men noses down into a book, a flickering candle between them. Upon hearing you, the lord quickly looks up and explains the situation at hand: they have deciphered the location of a great artifact, an artifact which very well may contain the answer to the dead walking the earth. %employer% nods dutifully.%SPEECH_ON%We have reason to believe that you won't be alone in seeking it out, nor that where it lies is the safest of places to begin with.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% takes a torch off a brazier and takes you down into some crypts. You watch as ghoulish statues emerge from the dark, the nobleman's flame bringing life to shades and shadows. He pauses before one then turns around.%SPEECH_ON%This is my father. Listen closely.%SPEECH_OFF%You put your ear toward the enormous sarcophagus and hear a faint scratching from within. %employer% shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%My scribes have deciphered the location of a supposed great artifact. It lies %direction% from here in a place called '%objective%'. It may or may not contain the power to end this madness. Of course, such power never exists quietly in this world. We expect many others, man or otherwise, to be around the artifact. Go there, sellsword, and bring it back to me and you will be rewarded.%SPEECH_OFF%He waves the torch back to the coffin which emits a muted growl.%SPEECH_ON%For our sake and theirs.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% and his scribe take you down into the catacombs. There you find a coffin which has been broken open. Two guards stand with pikes to push a ghoulish and decaying woman from attacking. She snarls and snaps at them, teeth chomping in hollow clatters as the firelight fills her gaunt shapes. %employer% turns to you.%SPEECH_ON%We know not what this is or what started it, but we think that a location called '%objective%' which lies %direction% from here may contain the answer. An artifact of some power is supposed to be there and I need you bring it back. My scribe states you should prepare for dangers unknown.%SPEECH_OFF%The walking dead girl growls and lurches forward, impaling herself on a blade and pushing herself down it. The scribe nods and %employer% continues.%SPEECH_ON%If it can end this torment, who knows what else it may do.%SPEECH_OFF%}\""
