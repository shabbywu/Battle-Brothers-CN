This area is located deep within hostile territory and I have reason to believe you won't be the only ones looking for it. Go there, bring the artifact back to me and I will reward you handsomely.%SPEECH_OFF% | When you meet %employer% he hurriedly implores you to come to his side and read a book. You see a language that you know not ever existed, but there's also a map on the pages which needs no translation, in particular the location upon it which is heavily circled by a quill pen. %employer% taps it.%SPEECH_ON%I need you to go there, sellsword. They call it '%objective%'. My scribes state it holds an artifact of great power that we could use to fight off the undead scourge. Of course, an artifact such as that isn't going to just be sitting out in the open. I'd very much expect all manner of man and creature to be prowling that area, drawn by the hum of the artifact's very power! You need to get it and bring it back.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% welcomes you and quickly describes a location called '%objective%', some horrid place that lies %direction% from where you are.%SPEECH_ON%My scribes state this area holds an artifact of immense power that could help us fight off the undead scourge. Of course, they might just be trying to sell me on getting something they want to study. For now, I believe them. I need you to go there and find it. Immense power is magnetizing so I would not expect to be the only goof footing around out there, understand? Go and bring it back to me and you will be rewarded accordingly.%SPEECH_OFF% | You find a scribe leaning into %employer%'s ear, whispering things that has the nobleman nodding repeatedly. Upon seeing you, he quickly explains the situation.%SPEECH_ON%Sellsword! I have gotten... news, that a place %direction% of here contains an immense power we need to get a hold of. I think it will help us fight off the undead scourge. Of course, if it really has the power to do that then we can easily assume others will be looking for this item, too! For that reason, speed is of the utmost importance. I want you there and back.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% is found stepping through his personal graveyard. He stands before a gravestone.%SPEECH_ON%Every night, I worry that these will start moving and my ancestors will rise up, come to destroy me for my failings.%SPEECH_OFF%He turns and looks at you with a cold grimace on his face. Without speaking, he takes you into his home where an old man is poring over books completely covering his desk. %employer% tells you to speak to the man and then goes and stands by the door. You sit down across from the elder who puts down his quill pen.%SPEECH_ON%{My liege has granted me the honor of telling you everything you need to know. I have identified an artifact of great power located %direction% of here in a place called '%objective%'. I believe this artifact may contain the power to help resolve this issue with the dead... coming alive again. I also believe that power of this magnitude does not go unnoticed in this world. You need to go there, fight off anyone who thinks it belongs to them, and return to us. | Welcome, sellsword. It is not often I go to a man of your vocation to solve my problems. A good book and a quiet evening used to more than suffice, but no longer. We need you to travel %direction% of here to a place called '%objective%'. We have reason to believe it may contain the answer to our problem of the dead walking among us. Of course, such power is a powerful lure. You need to move fast to get there and back, lest we may lose it.}%SPEECH_OFF% | A scribe stands at %employer%'s side. Both men are staring at a piece of paper. As you near, they slowly push it across the table for you to read. It appears that the scribe has located a place of immense power and they believe it may contain the solution to the undead scourge. %employer% believes many others will be hunting for it, too, and that speed is of the utmost importance. | You find %employer% talking to a scribe, both men noses down into a book, a flickering candle between them. Upon hearing you, the lord quickly looks up and explains the situation at hand: they have deciphered the location of a great artifact, an artifact which very well may contain the answer to the dead walking the earth. %employer% nods dutifully.%SPEECH_ON%We have reason to believe that you won't be alone in seeking it out, nor that where it lies is the safest of places to begin with.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% takes a torch off a brazier and takes you down into some crypts. You watch as ghoulish statues emerge from the dark, the nobleman's flame bringing life to shades and shadows. He pauses before one then turns around.%SPEECH_ON%This is my father. Listen closely.%SPEECH_OFF%You put your ear toward the enormous sarcophagus and hear a faint scratching from within. %employer% shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%My scribes have deciphered the location of a supposed great artifact. It lies %direction% from here in a place called '%objective%'. It may or may not contain the power to end this madness. Of course, such power never exists quietly in this world. We expect many others, man or otherwise, to be around the artifact. Go there, sellsword, and bring it back to me and you will be rewarded.%SPEECH_OFF%He waves the torch back to the coffin which emits a muted growl.%SPEECH_ON%For our sake and theirs.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% and his scribe take you down into the catacombs. There you find a coffin which has been broken open. Two guards stand with pikes to push a ghoulish and decaying woman from attacking. She snarls and snaps at them, teeth chomping in hollow clatters as the firelight fills her gaunt shapes. %employer% turns to you.%SPEECH_ON%We know not what this is or what started it, but we think that a location called '%objective%' which lies %direction% from here may contain the answer. An artifact of some power is supposed to be there and I need you bring it back. My scribe states you should prepare for dangers unknown.%SPEECH_OFF%The walking dead girl growls and lurches forward, impaling herself on a blade and pushing herself down it. The scribe nods and %employer% continues.%SPEECH_ON%If it can end this torment, who knows what else it may do.%SPEECH_OFF%}",
