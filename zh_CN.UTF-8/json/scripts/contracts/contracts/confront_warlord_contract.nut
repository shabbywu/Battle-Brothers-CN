You should expect that savage sooner or later. Most likely the former. | With this many orc and goblin killings, it is only a matter of time until their head master personally comes after you. | If orcs speak the language of violence, then you've been penning a real love letter up and down the region. Surely the orc warlord will be in a requiting mood. | If violence is the orcish language for love, then you've been standing in their warlord's yard throwing a lot of rocks through the window trying to get its attention. But, instead of rocks, it's the limbs and heads of its soldiers. That brute will be sure to respond any day now. | You've left a long trail of dead greenskins no doubt sure to attract the attention of their warlord. | Business is good for the buzzards: you've cut a path of dead greenskins and it seems likely that, any day now, their warlord will come and see for himself what you are up to. | Killing greenskins like you've been doing is a surefire way to get an orc warlord's attention - and that heat is rising. | If things keep going according to plan, that is to say the unimpeded slaughter of green savages, then surely it is only a matter of time until an orc warlord comes to see you personally. | A stampede could hardly make more noise than you have this past week. If you keep it up with slaying greenskins left and right, it is but a matter of time until their warlord shows up. | You have a feeling that somewhere in this region is a very, very mad orc warlord staring at a crude drawing of your face. | You like to think you've generated 'wanted' posters of yourself within the greenskin circles. A stick figure of a man with a price beneath it. Wanted Dead or Very Dead. Problem is you'll keep killing all who come your way until the orc warlord himself makes an appearance - and you got the feeling that will be happening real soon. | Surely by now the greenskins are sharing stories of you around their campfires. Some damned human terrorizing their ranks. And you've little doubt an orc warlord would hear those stories and feel compelled to see for himself if what they say are true... | Keep killing greenskins like this and their warlord will be sure to come around. | You're treading dangerous waters now. With this many greenskins slain, the orc warlord is sure to be coming sooner or later. | You've got a strong inclination that the orc warlord is going to be coming around real soon. Might have something to do with you killing all his soldiers. Just a hunch. | You've killed little greenskins and big greenskins. Now, it's time to kill the biggest of them all: a warlord. That savage has gotta be footing around here somewhere... | You've made war on the greenskins and for that their warlord is sure to appear sooner or later. | Greenskins dying left and right. At some point their warlord is going to realize that it ain't because of natural causes. Once he figures it out, he'll be coming for you double time.}",

The war with the greenskins isn't going as well as we'd like, so I've come to the conclusion that we must kill one of their warlords. Let me be honest with you: an orc that is physically superior to all its shite little brothers is a nightmare in flesh and blood.

Of course, kill the greenskins. Don't just be indiscriminate about this. | Glad you've come, sellsword, because boy do I have a task for you. We've gotten word that an orc warlord is in the region, but we know not where he is.

The problem is, we don't know where it is or where it goes. The scouts can't really stick with it for long or else they'll get killed for hopefully obvious reasons.
