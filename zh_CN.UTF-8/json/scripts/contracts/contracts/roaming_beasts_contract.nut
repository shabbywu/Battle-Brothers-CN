He weighs it carefully, the lumps of coin curving about his fingers, their chink and chanks muted. He turns to you.%SPEECH_ON%You recognize that name?%SPEECH_OFF%You shake your head. The man continues.%SPEECH_ON%A week ago we sent the famed %randomnoble% %direction% of here to go hunt down some foul beasts that have been terrorizing the town and surrounding farmsteads for weeks. Do you know why this satchel has remained in my ownership?%SPEECH_OFF%You shrug and answer.%SPEECH_ON%Because he hasn't returned?%SPEECH_OFF%%employer% nods and sets the satchel down. He sits on the edge of his table.%SPEECH_ON%Correct. Because he has not returned. Now, why do you think that is? I think it's because he's dead, but let's not be so negative. I think it's because the beasts out there require more. I think they require someone like you, sellsword. Would you be willing to help us now that this nobleman has failed?%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% takes a book from his shelf. When he sets it on his table, dust or maybe even ash plume outward. He opens it up, thumbing slowly from page to page.%SPEECH_ON%Do you believe in monsters, sellsword? I'm asking honestly, as I believe you've had a better walk-about of this world than I.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and speak.%SPEECH_ON%More than just a belief, yes.%SPEECH_OFF%The man thumbs another page. He looks up at you.%SPEECH_ON%Well, we believe monsters have come to %townname%. We believe that's why people are going missing. Understand where this is going? I need you to find these 'make believe' creatures and kill them like any other. Are you interested?%SPEECH_OFF%}\""
