And, dear sellsword, business is at hand. One of my commander has reported that the armies of %feudfamily% are coming together.

I get that. You know him, you know his temperament, and what he's capable of. Question is...%SPEECH_OFF%The sellsword grins, the wily smile reflected in the sheen of his blade.%SPEECH_ON%Do you know me?%SPEECH_OFF% | The deserters look about ready to leave when %bigdog% whistles loudly.%SPEECH_ON%Hey you shits, my commander gave you an order.%SPEECH_OFF%One of the deserter scoffs.%SPEECH_ON%Yeah? He ain't our farkin' commander so you can take that order and cram it.%SPEECH_OFF%%bigdog% draws out a huge blade and plants it in the ground. He tents his hands atop the pommel.%SPEECH_ON%You're afraid of %commander% and that's alright. But you keep on being a little shit, my friend, and we'll see just which commander you should have really been afraid of.%SPEECH_OFF% | The deserters turn to leave. %bigdog% takes out a huge blade and clangs it against his armor. Slowly, the deserters turn around. %bigdog% smiles.%SPEECH_ON%Any one of you ever pissed your pants?%SPEECH_OFF%One of the deserters shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%H-hey man, get the fark out of here with that talk.%SPEECH_OFF%%bigdog% snatches up his blade and points the tip of it at the deserter.%SPEECH_ON%Oh, you want me shut up? Keep speaking to me like that and there won't be anybody talking here real soon.%SPEECH_OFF%}{The deserters cannot decide amongst themselves and put it to a vote. The choice to keep running carries the majority. Their leader informs you of this democratic result and bids you farewell. %commander% won't be happy, but you draw out your sword and tell the men there's only one other path for them to go. The leader turns around, unsheathing his blade and nodding.%SPEECH_ON%Alright, I figured you didn't come all this way just to hear us say goodbye. At arms, men.%SPEECH_OFF% | %commander% will hate it, but the deserters refuse to come back. They see no reason to jump back into the fray. You tell their leader good luck. He thanks you, but quickly falls silent as you draw out your weapon, the rest of the %companyname% following suit. The leader sighs.%SPEECH_ON%Yeah, I thought this is how it'd go.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod.%SPEECH_ON%Nothing personal. I don't care what you do, but this here is a matter of business and we have to see it to its conclusion.%SPEECH_OFF% | The deserters are unable to come to a decision so they turn to chance: their leader takes out a coin and flips it through the air. Heads they go back to camp, tails they keep on leaving. It lands tails. The deserters collectively breathe a sigh of relief. Their leader claps you on the shoulder.%SPEECH_ON%Fortune has decided our fates.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and draw out your sword, the rest of the company following suit.%SPEECH_ON%You keep that in mind when we're killing the lot of you.%SPEECH_OFF%The leader smiles weakly as he draws his blade.%SPEECH_ON%It's quite alright. We'd rather die on freedom's doorstep than go back to that grind.%SPEECH_OFF% | The leader politely refuses to come back.%SPEECH_ON%We didn't choose this path lightly, sellsword. We're not coming back.%SPEECH_OFF%You order the %companyname% to draw out their weapons. The deserter's leader sighs, but nods understandingly.%SPEECH_ON%I suppose it is what it is. We talked of this, and we are prepared to die here, walking where we wish, than die out there on some dog's orders. This is all the world to us now.%SPEECH_OFF%Shrugging, you respond.%SPEECH_ON%Tis only business for us.%SPEECH_OFF%}\""
