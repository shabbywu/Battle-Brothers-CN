Who would dare call such horrors 'cargo'? | You watch as one of the caravan guards lifts a cat from a crate.

He shrugs, lifting up the lid of a box and dropping the cat in.%SPEECH_ON%Feeding.%SPEECH_OFF%The cat shrieks, its feline squalls as fierce as its fight, but soon enough you hear nothing at all. Just as the caravan guard turns to leave the box, its lid bursts open and a pale creature shifts upward, almost incorporeal in its movement, and closes its arms around the man. It plunges its fangs into his neck. The guard's neck glows purple, then quickly begins to fade, his veins pressing out of his forehead as if trying to help his blood escape consumption.\n\n Backing away, you draw out your sword and alert your men to this newfound horror. | While taking a rest, a young caravan guard almost sneaks up on you.%SPEECH_ON%Hey sellsword, wanna see something?%SPEECH_OFF%You've got the time and time's got you bored, so yeah, of course you do.

You jump back, though, because that's no ordinary corpse. The caravan guard laughs.%SPEECH_ON%What, ya a little scared of the dead?%SPEECH_OFF%And just then, the creature's arm shoots up, grabbing the kid and dragging him into the box. You don't bother saving the idiot, but instead go to rally the battle brothers, all the while more boxes springing open all around you as you run. | Resting beside the road, you hear a horrid scream somewhere down the line of wagons. Drawing your sword, you quickly rush to the noise. A caravan guard limps past you, clutching his neck. His eyes are wide, his mouth frozen agape and speechless.%SPEECH_ON%They got out! They got out!%SPEECH_OFF%Another guard sprints by, not even bothering to stop to help the other. You look ahead to see a group of pale figures leaping from guard to guard, wrapping black cloaks around their victims to shade them into gruesome deaths. Before they can get to you, you turn back and alert the company of this horrifying danger. | While the wagontrain takes a break, you go around to check the carts and make sure everything is tidied up. The last wagon, though, is tilted into the ground, its draught animal dead in the mud. Nearby are two dead guards. They are completely white, yet posed in a freshly manner.

Walking around the end of a cart, you find a pale figure drooped over a dead caravan guard, the strange creature's fangs plunged deep into the man's neck. You can see the flesh lifting to the bite, the bloodslaked creature grinning as it drinks.\n\n Drawing your sword, you scream out to your mercenaries.%SPEECH_ON%Foul beasts! To arms, men!%SPEECH_OFF% | The lid of a box shifts around. You stare at it, exchanging a glance with a caravan guard.%SPEECH_ON%Y'all shipping dogs around?%SPEECH_OFF%Suddenly, the box lid explodes, splinters cascading from a source of great, angry power. Moaning, a creature rises up from the box, arms crossed over its chest. The face is pale, the skin taut and clearly cold. That's... a...\n\n The caravan guard runs away shouting.%SPEECH_ON%The cargo is loose! The cargo is loose!%SPEECH_OFF%Cargo? Who would dare call such horrors 'cargo'? | You watch as one of the caravan guards lifts a cat from a crate. The creature mewls as its legs dangle, kicking around for some footing, and then angrily kicking around to scratch what has lofted it just so. Interested, you inquire as to what the man is doing. He shrugs, lifting up the lid of a box and dropping the cat in.%SPEECH_ON%Feeding.%SPEECH_OFF%The cat shrieks, its feline squalls as fierce as its fight, but soon enough you hear nothing at all. Just as the caravan guard turns to leave the box, its lid bursts open and a pale creature shifts upward, almost incorporeal in its movement, and closes its arms around the man. It plunges its fangs into his neck. The guard's neck glows purple, then quickly begins to fade, his veins pressing out of his forehead as if trying to help his blood escape consumption.\n\n Backing away, you draw out your sword and alert your men to this newfound horror. | While taking a rest, a young caravan guard almost sneaks up on you.%SPEECH_ON%Hey sellsword, wanna see something?%SPEECH_OFF%You've got the time and time's got you bored, so yeah, of course you do. He takes you to one of the carts and lifts back a lid on a box. A pale figure is inside, arms crossed over its chest, its face colorless and taut in some sleepy content. You jump back, though, because that's no ordinary corpse. The caravan guard laughs.%SPEECH_ON%What, ya a little scared of the dead?%SPEECH_OFF%And just then, the creature's arm shoots up, grabbing the kid and dragging him into the box. You don't bother saving the idiot, but instead go to rally the battle brothers, all the while more boxes springing open all around you as you run. | Resting beside the road, you hear a horrid scream somewhere down the line of wagons. Drawing your sword, you quickly rush to the noise. A caravan guard limps past you, clutching his neck. His eyes are wide, his mouth frozen agape and speechless.%SPEECH_ON%They got out! They got out!%SPEECH_OFF%Another guard sprints by, not even bothering to stop to help the other. You look ahead to see a group of pale figures leaping from guard to guard, wrapping black cloaks around their victims to shade them into gruesome deaths. Before they can get to you, you turn back and alert the company of this horrifying danger. | While the wagontrain takes a break, you go around to check the carts and make sure everything is tidied up. The last wagon, though, is tilted into the ground, its draught animal dead in the mud. Nearby are two dead guards. They are completely white, yet posed in a freshly manner. Taking your gaze up, you find blood-faced creatures hunched atop the wagon, and they've got men dangling from their mouths!\n\n%randombrother% comes up behind you, weapon in hand, and pushes you back.%SPEECH_ON%Let's alert the men, sir!%SPEECH_OFF%That's about as good of an idea as one can have at the moment. You shout as loud as you can, ushering the rest of your men to combat. | You go to take a piss when a horrid shriek gives you pause. Dressing yourself, you turn back around and rush to the disturbance. There you find a caravan guard falling forward, his legs scissoring and stumbling before he falls on his face. Behind him, a pale creature is wiping blood from its mouth. And on the wagons there are boxes opening up, pallid shapes rising up out of them with bloodlust in their eyes.\n\n You've seen more than enough and go to alert the men.}\""
