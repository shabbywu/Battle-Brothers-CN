Splendid work murdering those savages. Surely this will make them think twice about venturing down here again!%SPEECH_OFF%The man pays you what you're owed. | You enter %employer%'s room and find him slackened into his chair. He's watching a naked woman saunter from one side of the room to the other. Shaking his head, he talks to you while not taking his eyes from the show.%SPEECH_ON%My scouts have already told me of your doings. Said you put it to the barbarians like they'd done their wrongs against you personally. I like that. I like the lack of restraint. Wish more of my own men had it.%SPEECH_OFF%A servant, previously unseen, quickly marches across the room. He's got a red candle atop his head and a chest of crowns in his hands. You take your pay and leave the room as quick as you can. | You find %employer% and a group of armored men standing around a table. A barbarian's corpse is on it. The flesh is greyed, but the body's musculature and grit has not yet been decayed. They ask if you truly fought men of this sort. You cut to the chase and ask for your pay. %employer% claps and shows you off to the group.%SPEECH_ON%Gentlemen, this is the sort of man I want in my ranks! Unfearful and always focused.%SPEECH_OFF%One of the nobles spits and says something you don't hear. You ask him to speak up if he's something to say, but %employer% rushes forward, chest of crowns in hand, and sends you on your way. | Finding %employer% proves a little difficult, a hunt that ends in a seemingly abandoned barn. You see him standing before a dead barbarian, the corpse hanging from the rafters by his legs like a fisherman's haul. The body has been burned, mutilated, and all else. %employer% crouches and washes his hands in a bucket.%SPEECH_ON%I've to say, sellsword, you killing a whole number of these savages is most impressive. This one here lasted a good long while. Took to the pain like he was gonna pay it forward to me tenfold. But he never did. Did you?%SPEECH_OFF%The man gently slaps the barbarian's face and the chains clink as the body gently twists. %employer% nods.%SPEECH_ON%A servant outside will have your pay. A job well done, sellsword.%SPEECH_OFF% | You find %employer% and a group of men overseeing the defense of %townname%, no doubt preparing themselves for whatever attack may come next. Judging by the appearance of the men, their ambitions of survival will meet a reality far more cruel than they are ready for. But you keep that to yourself. %employer% thanks you for a job well done and pays you what is owed. | A few denizens of %townname% see your return with horrified confusion, mistaking you for the savages that they'd come to know. Windows are shuttered, doors slammed closed, children hurried away, and a few braver souls step out with pitchforks. %employer% hurries out of his abode and sets them straight, explaining you are the heroes of the tale, that you went north and annihilated the savages, burned their village, and scattered them to the wastes. Windows swing wide and doors creak open and the children return to their play. Just when you think order has returned, an old woman snarls.%SPEECH_ON%A sellsword is just a savage by another name!%SPEECH_OFF%Sighing, you tell %employer% to pay what is owed. | %employer% is studying a few scrolls. He's also penning notes into them and crossing others out. Looking up, he explains that he's putting you into the records as a 'hero who went to the wastes' and 'slaughtered the savages in a fashion most proper and southernly.' He asks you to remind him what your name is. You ask him to pay you what you're owed. | %employer% is in the company of a group of sobbing women. He's consoling them and when you enter he stands and points you out to them.%SPEECH_ON%Behold! The man who has slain those who murdered your husbands!%SPEECH_OFF%The women wail and clamber to you, one after the other, and you know what to do besides nod sternly and stoically. %employer% is the last of the crowd to find you, a chest of crowns in his arm and a wry smile on his lips. You take your pay and the man returns to the women.%SPEECH_ON%There there, fine ladies, the world will see a new dawn. Please, come with me. Does anyone want wine?%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% welcomes you with open arms. You decline a hug and ask for your pay. He returns to his desk.%SPEECH_ON%I wasn't trying to hug you, sellsword.%SPEECH_OFF%He taps the chest rather despondently.%SPEECH_ON%But you did a good job slaughtering those savages. I've a number of scouts who reported it as a 'splendid time' you had out there. You've earned this.%SPEECH_OFF%He pushes the chest across the desk and you take it at arm's length, meeting a slight bit of resistance as he holds onto it. You hurriedly leave the room without looking at him again. | You have a hard time finding %employer%, eventually finding him halfway down a well shaft plugging a hole with a stone slab. He shouts up to you.%SPEECH_ON%Ah, the sellsword. Hoist me up, men!%SPEECH_OFF%A pulley system draws up the plank upon which he sits. He swings his legs off and rests them on the rim of the wellhead.%SPEECH_ON%Our mason was killed by a donkey so I thought I'd lend a hand myself. Nothing like a little dirty work to get a good man up in the morn'.%SPEECH_OFF%He slaps your chest with his glove, it leaves a powdered outline. He nods and fetches a servant to go get your pay.%SPEECH_ON%A job well done, sellsword. Very, very well done. Heh.%SPEECH_OFF%You don't humor him. | %employer% is found giving a speech to a crowd of peasants. He describes an unnamed force of southerners that headed north and annihilated the savage scum. At no point are you or the %companyname% named. When he's done, the mob of peons cheer and clap and flowers are thrown and a general state of festivity takes over. %employer% seeks you out and shakes your hand while pushing a chest of crowns toward you.%SPEECH_ON%I wish I could call you the hero to these fine folk, but mercenaries are not seen in the best of light.%SPEECH_OFF%You wrap your hands around the payment and lean forward.%SPEECH_ON%All I want is the pay. Have fun out there, %employer%.%SPEECH_OFF% | You find %employer% attending a funeral ceremony. They're burning a pyre weighed with three corpses and what may possibly be a fourth, smaller one. Possibly a whole family. %employer% says a few kind words and then sets the woodwork ablaze. A servant surprises you with a chest of crowns.%SPEECH_ON%%employer% does not wish to be bothered.
