Certainly!%SPEECH_OFF%Before you can ask the nature of the business, the Vizier holds up a golden chalice with half of the cupping sliced like the rim of the moon.%SPEECH_ON%Our holiest land, %holysite%, has been taken by savage northerners. Our world is threatened with darkness, and to fend the shadow we must be propitious in our endeavors. The men of my domain are plenty, but the lands beneath the Gilder's eye stretch far. I need soldiers such as yourself to help claim %holysite%. For it is a part of this earth which the Gilder is suzerain, and the Gilder pays us all: %reward% crowns for the task's completion. Do we have an arrangement?%SPEECH_OFF% | In a rare sight, you find %employer% prostrated beneath the sublimity of a glinting, shiny emblem shaped like the sun. He whispers a few words to himself then rises, then whispers again, cleans his fingertips one at a time, and turns to you.%SPEECH_ON%Whilst my troops make propitious advances elsewhere, %holysite% has been left undefended. In my wont to win this war, I have left the door open for the barbarian northerners to take it over. I request, face to face with you, a parcel of outside help. The Gilder will provide us all the gilded path, Crownling, and you are not outside His generosity. Through my hand, you shall have %reward% crowns if you take back %holysite%!%SPEECH_OFF% | A golden goblet scatters across the marbled floors and the wine sprays every which way. The Vizier yells at you, a mix of anger and need.%SPEECH_ON%Finally, someone who can be of assistance!%SPEECH_OFF%He waves off a few helpers and even a few of what appear to be his own lieutenants.%SPEECH_ON%Crownling, %holysite% has been conquered by the northern filth. I have wept at the thought of them ransacking it, and I shall weep again for every day they sully one of the Gilder's footprints. %reward% crowns. That is how much shall be procured and placed into your pockets. A hefty amount for you, surely, but it is true what they say, that for some the way of the gilded path is perhaps more literal than for others.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% is surrounded by silk-laden men. One carries fireflies in a hooded cage, the dull insect-lights winking here and there. The other has a cage with the remains of a dead bird, stripped entirely to the bone save for two feathers which seem to replicate the entirety of what were once its wings. Seeing you, the Vizier steps out between these men as one would step between the unmovable pillars of a temple.%SPEECH_ON%Crownling, you are here! My scouts have reported that we have taken a step back in this war against the dogs of the north. %holysite% has been captured and, per the Gilder's whispers, I must have it returned to us. Not only for my domain, but so that His sublimity may bear the slightest shade. You will be given %reward% crowns for this venture, a heavy sum for a heavy task, yes!%SPEECH_OFF% | Ordinarily ordained in opulence and surrounded by familiar profligates, you find %employer% kneeled and dressed in somewhat modest attire. He's wearing a headdress with corded black around his pate. The socially muted Vizier speaks to you calmly.%SPEECH_ON%Northern heathens have taken %holysite% from our lands. I do not blame them for their actions, they know not what it is they do. By my honest hands, the Gilder shall know my faults. But failure does not mean surrender. I need you to travel to the holy grounds and return it to our realm. For this, you shall have %reward% crowns placed within your coffers.%SPEECH_OFF%}\""
