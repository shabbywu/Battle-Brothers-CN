Greenskins, don't know what type, don't know how tall or what sort, but this way they do indeed come.%SPEECH_OFF%He throws back the rest of his drink, swallowing as though it were to be the last thing that'd go down his throat before an executioner removed his head.%SPEECH_ON%Will you stay here and protect us? For the right price, of course. I haven't forgotten your station yet.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer%'s by his window when you enter.%SPEECH_ON%You hear that?%SPEECH_OFF%A throng of people are practically baying in the streets, a mix of apathetic moans and outright horrified crying.%SPEECH_ON%That's what you hear when the greenskins are coming.%SPEECH_OFF%The man shutters the windows and turns to you.%SPEECH_ON%I know it's a lot to ask, but we do have money so I'll go ahead and ask anyway. Will you help protect %townname%?%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer%'s fighting off a crowd when you find him.%SPEECH_ON%Everyone calm down! Just calm down!%SPEECH_OFF%Someone throws an onion, battering the man upside the head with a tearjerking rap of sour vegetable. Someone else quickly scurries to pick it up and take a bite. %employer% points you out in the crowd.%SPEECH_ON%Sellsword! I am so glad you came!%SPEECH_OFF%He fights through the crowd. He leans in close to your ear, yet still has to shout to be heard.%SPEECH_ON%We have money! We have what you need! Just help protect this town from the greenskins!%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer%'s employees are rummaging about his room, collecting scrolls and books alike before hurrying off to who knows where. The man himself is simply sitting in his chair, occasionally drinking from a goblet while perusing a map. He waves you in.%SPEECH_ON%Take a seat. Don't mind my workers.%SPEECH_OFF%You do as asked, but it's hard to ignore the frenzy around you. %employer% sits back, tenting his fingers atop his belly.%SPEECH_ON%I'm sure you've noticed things are rather unusual around here. That's because a large band of greenskins have been spotted and they're heading this way, murdering and destroying all that stands before them. Obviously, I'd like you to help defend %townname% before we all end up in some scribe's footnote, understand?%SPEECH_OFF% | You enter %employer%'s abode and can't help but notice there's mud all over the floor and a squelched fire in his pit. Some of his workers hurry about with scrolls stuffed in their arms. You can barely even see their heads over all the paper. You see %employer% standing in the midst of the chaos, simply directing his employees to do this or that. When you walk up to him he simply nods.%SPEECH_ON%Greenskins are coming. What kind? I don't know. What I do know is what will happen if I can't help defend this town which is why we're doing a little bit of prep work here, understand?%SPEECH_OFF%You nod in return, but then ask what else he wants.%SPEECH_ON%Help us fight these greenskins, of course. There's plenty of money in it for you, obviously.%SPEECH_OFF% | Peasants have come to %employer%'s abode. They're carrying armfuls of belongings, a litter of it trailing behind their every step, so urgent to flee they don't even bother picking up any of it. %employer% himself sees you through one of his window's and waves you to come in through a side door. When you sneak in, he simply plops down in his chair and pours you a drink.%SPEECH_ON%Greenskins are coming and I don't believe there are enough men on hand to defend %townname%. Obviously, I'm willing to call on and pay for your services to help keep %townname% safe from this green menace.%SPEECH_OFF% | A man is standing outside %employer%'s abode, two painted slabs of wood dressed over himself. On each board is written some prophetic doomsayer's tale. You ignore the man and enter the house. %employer% is standing there, laughing and shaking his head.%SPEECH_ON%That guy standing out there ain't wrong. My scouts have been reporting greenskins moving through the area for a while. I should have listened for how my scouts haven't said anything for a good week, presumably because those very same greenskins got their hands on them. Now I got the commonfolk coming to me with horror stories of what is going on out there, and how a large horde of those awful creatures are coming this way.%SPEECH_OFF%He turns to you, grinning, madness spinning in his grin.%SPEECH_ON%So what say you and I broker a deal and shut up that doomsayer's shrill crying? Will you help protect %townname%?%SPEECH_OFF%}\""
