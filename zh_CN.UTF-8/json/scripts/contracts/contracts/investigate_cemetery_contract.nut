The necromancer died and, like any man, fell into a pile of his own flesh and bones. Curious that his wizard tricks could raise the dead, but not be cast while being dead. Curious, but not unfortunate, either. You take the heathen's head, just in case. | You've slain the necromancer but, worried that his tricks might go beyond the grave, cut his head off his shoulders and stick it in a sack. %employer%, your employer, should be most happy to see it. | The battle over, you take a sword to the necromancer's neck and remove his head from his shoulders. It comes almost too freely, as though it wanted to be in your holding. Well, whatever the case, %employer%, your employer, will want to see it as proof of your doings here.}\""
