A good map, however, is gold.%SPEECH_OFF%With the fire starting to lick his fingers, the man drops the paper and stomps it.

It is, simply, the most beautiful map you've ever seen. %employer% uses two sticks to pinpoint two distinct spots.%SPEECH_ON%'%objective1%' and '%objective2%', two colorful names. This is where my spies say the undead are coming from. Well, the most of those monsters, anyway. Go to both, sellsword, and help put an end to these horrors.%SPEECH_OFF% | You step into %employer%'s room. His generals are red-faced, the crimson bookend of an argument gone south. The nobleman waves you in.%SPEECH_ON%Ah, a man I'd actually like to farkin' speak to. Men, make a path.%SPEECH_OFF%Being scornfully eyed, you step through the sea of haughty commanders. %employer% slaps a map into your chest. There are two locations highlighted with circles and crudely drawn skulls and crossbones.%SPEECH_ON%Go to both, sellsword. '%objective1%' and '%objective2%'. My scribes believe that these are critical to the waves of undead. My commanders disagree, but why not have a look? Now if you see any of those scary shits, kill them, destroy whatever goddam holes they're crawling out of, and return to me with the brilliant news of your heroics. Sound like a deal?%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% is tending to his garden. The vegetables have gone grey. His fingers scrape ash off the vines.%SPEECH_ON%I'm saddened, sellsword, by the state of things, but at the very least my farkin' food isn't coming back alive to bite my arse.%SPEECH_OFF%You laugh and respond.%SPEECH_ON%Give it time. We've no measure of how vengeful a vegetable may be.%SPEECH_OFF%The nobleman nods earnestly, as though you were a philosopher and not a jokester. He throws you a map.%SPEECH_ON%You'll find two spots marked, '%objective1%' and '%objective2%'. Supposedly, both are warrens for the undead. Go there, kill them all, and destroy their homes. Or graves. Pits. Whatever.%SPEECH_OFF% | A sad looking peasant, which is to say an ordinary peasant, leaves %employer%'s room as you enter. He waves you to his desk.%SPEECH_ON%Glad you are here, sellsword, because I have quite the task for you. My scouts report of two spots of keen interest to me and the people of these lands. They're called '%objective1%' and '%objective2%' and, supposedly, the undead are pouring out of both. So, what say you go there and find out? And by find out I mean kill them all if it's true and come back to me with the good news.%SPEECH_OFF% | You find %employer% staring at a dead cat on his desk. The feline critter has a dagger sticking out of its chest and you realize the nobleman is holding another blade in hand. A guard stands by the wayside, sword already out, and a scribe near to him with a quill pen and scroll. You step across the room as everybody slowly relaxes. Blades are sheathed, pens are set to scribbling. The scribe hurries the cat away to the gods know what purposes. %employer% takes a seat.%SPEECH_ON%Greetings, sellsword. We were having a bit of an experiment. We didn't believe cats really had nine lives, but in this new world of horrors they just might have two. As it turns out, no. They don't. One is all they got.%SPEECH_OFF%The nobleman pulls out a map and slaps it across his desk. He points to two marks.%SPEECH_ON%'%objective1%', here. '%objective2%' is here. Go to both. If my scouts are right, you'll find the undead there. Lots of them. You are to destroy everything there and ensure this undead filth is nipped at the bud.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% is standing with a road-worn scout at his side. The pathfinder is eating his fill of food and drink, replenishing whatever he lost sprinting across the lands. %employer% presents you a crudely drawn map.%SPEECH_ON%'%objective1%' and '%objective2%'. We, well, my sir friendly bird here, believes that these are repositories for the undead, now doubt aptly named. From these spots spawn all manner of unholies. Go to them, destroy all that you see, and come back a hero.%SPEECH_OFF%You shrug.%SPEECH_ON%The %companyname% prefers crowns to accolades.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% welcomes you with a map.%SPEECH_ON%'%objective1%' and '%objective2%', recognize those places? No, of course not. But I want you to go to each, root out what evil lies in them, and come back. Short and simple jaunt into the repositories of the dead, right?%SPEECH_OFF%Right. What could possibly go wrong? | %employer% asks if you fear the undead. You shrug and respond.%SPEECH_ON%I fear dying with regret that I did not do all that I wanted to do. That's about all I fear. That and horses.%SPEECH_OFF%The nobleman laughs.%SPEECH_ON%Well, alright then. Here's a map. You'll see marked '%objective1%' and '%objective2%'. My scouts believe they are havens for the undead. Makes sense as that is where we put our dead in the first place. Go to both, destroy them, and head on back for your pay. Simple enough, yeah?%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% greets you at his door with a map in hand.%SPEECH_ON%'%objective1%' and '%objective2%', marked clearly, see? Of course you do. Well my little birds say great evils are pouring out of both. If that's true, then I need a man of fearless, killing stature to go to both and destroy all that is there. I believe you are such a man. Are you?%SPEECH_OFF% | A well-armed, though sad-faced man is seen leaving %employer%'s room. When you enter, the nobleman waves you to his desk to look at a map.%SPEECH_ON%Yer not fearful of the dead, are you? How about the undead? No? Perfect. '%objective1%' is there, and '%objective2%' there. Go to both, destroy them, and show that recreant who just walked out that door what a real man can do.%SPEECH_OFF%You hold up a corrective finger.%SPEECH_ON%What a real man can do - for the right price.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% welcomes you into his room with an odd question.%SPEECH_ON%Ever been to a graveyard, sellsword?%SPEECH_OFF%Before you answer, the man pours himself a drink and takes a swig, holding the other hand out to keep you silent.%SPEECH_ON%They're curious things. Unnatural, really. What sort of creature takes its dead and goes out to some land, a good piece of land no less, and buries them there? How gaudy. How inconsequential. Is it any surprise, then, that the dead come back? Perhaps they're haunting us for breaking the natural order.%SPEECH_OFF%The man tosses you a scroll and upon it is a well-drawn map. Two spots are marked.%SPEECH_ON%'%objective1%' and '%objective2%'. I need you to go to both, destroy them, and come on back. Simple enough for a man of your profession, right?%SPEECH_OFF% | You find %employer% shaking his head as he works a quill pen across a map.%SPEECH_ON%'%objective1%' and '%objective2%', two little shiteholes not so far from here, need destroyin'. O'course, they're home to the dead and, thusly, the undead. They've given us no rest and now, well, can one of these corpses be put to rest? Who knows. But kill them all, got it?%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% is found tending to dozens of caged birds. Some flaps around their jails, banging into the bars. The nobleman picks up a dead bird, frightful legs stiff in the air. He tosses you the body.%SPEECH_ON%I've got a task for you, sellsword. '%objective1%' and '%objective2%' not far from here need destroying. My scouts have reported, courtesy of these little birds, that these locations are home to the undead, perhaps a source, or a base of operations, if the corpses could ever organize such a thing.%SPEECH_OFF%The man starts throwing birdseed into the dens. A few birds stare at the feed and choose to not eat, not being compulsory in the theft of the greatest gift nature has to offer. Birds with clipped wings, however, chow down. %employer% turns to you, clapping the residue off his hands.%SPEECH_ON%So, do we have a deal?%SPEECH_OFF% | You find %employer% surrounded by his guards with all eyes on a corpse in the middle of the room. An awful smell greets you well before the nobleman does. A miasma wafts off the body, a hue of lazy grey as though it was a pile of ash in a breezeway.%SPEECH_ON%Sellsword! Good to have you here! Ignore this commotion, if you can. We had an issue with a guardsman committing suicide and, well, coming back. A complicated plan of assassination, perhaps? Hard to say in this world. Come, I have something for you.%SPEECH_OFF%He waves you forward, a scroll in an outreached hand. You take it and unfurl a map. The man explains what it is.%SPEECH_ON%'%objective1%' and '%objective2%', if you recognize them, are repositories from which we believe that the undead are coming out of. I need a man of your, eh, steely stature to go there and put an end to both spots. Hopefully it is something that interests you.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% welcomes you into his room, but a guard checks your throat with the blade of a polearm. You keep calm as the nobleman quickly orders his man to stand down. The nobleman apologizes.%SPEECH_ON%Sorry for that unfortunate event, but the men are on edge. The other night one of them died in his sleep and, well, he came back. A ghoulish, growling beast that killed three men before anyone even knew what was happening.%SPEECH_OFF%You rub your chin, remarking you needed a good shave anyway. %employer% nods with a grin.%SPEECH_ON%Mmm, that's what I like you, sellsword. Always in good spirit. Look at this map I have. See these spots? '%objective1%' and '%objective2%' the peasantry calls them. We have reason to believe that both are incredible sources of power fueling the undead hordes. I need a man of your stature and resolve to go there and destroy them. Does this interest you, mercenary?%SPEECH_OFF% | You find %employer% leaning back in his chair. He throws you a map.%SPEECH_ON%Read it, study it. See '%objective1%' and '%objective2%'? My spies believe they are home to incredible powers that are fueling the undead. I think they're just home to a lot of dead bodies for the undead to reincarnate.

You've earned %reward_completion% crowns well.%SPEECH_OFF%The scribe speaks, startling %employer%.%SPEECH_ON%Indeed the evils have been put to ruin and all that is good is permitted to grow!

A few sextons sit nearby sharing a goatskin water flask. The nobleman shrugs.%SPEECH_ON%The body's stayed in the earth.

Good work with the undead, sellsword, and may your services here put us one step closer to ending this evil altogether.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% welcomes you with a flagon of wine. It carries a metallic taste, but you're sure to not comment on that. The nobleman carries a spry jaunt as he walks around to his desk.%SPEECH_ON%Good work, sellsword. Who knows what would have become of these lands if it weren't for men such as yourself. I pray to the old gods that, one day soon, we will be completely rid of all this evil!%SPEECH_OFF% | A guard meets you outside %employer%'s room.

Ouch. Hey.%SPEECH_OFF%He taps a razor into a basin of water before hurrying to his desk.%SPEECH_ON%My little birds have already told me of your doings. Not only that, but everyone seems all the better for it! The children laugh again, the sun shines bright, the crops are supposedly growing strong! Everyone is happy!%SPEECH_OFF%The woman asks if she can put the mirror down. The nobleman snaps his fingers.%SPEECH_ON%Hush, you. Now here, sellsword. %reward_completion% crowns, just as we agreed.%SPEECH_OFF% | You find %employer% not in his room, but in some darkened chamber with scant candles to provide light. There's a man in this dripping, soggy room hanging from some chains. Judging by his face, he looks as if he'd rather be hanging from a rope. The nobleman stands with his arms behind his back while a black-hooded figure runs an indecisive finger along a tray of blades. You cough. %employer% spins around.%SPEECH_ON%Ah yes, sellsword! I'd been expecting you! Here, %reward_completion% crowns, as promised. Hopefully the undead stay away for good this time.
