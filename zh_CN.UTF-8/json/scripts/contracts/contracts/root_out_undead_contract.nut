Hopefully it is something that interests you.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% welcomes you into his room, but a guard checks your throat with the blade of a polearm. You keep calm as the nobleman quickly orders his man to stand down. The nobleman apologizes.%SPEECH_ON%Sorry for that unfortunate event, but the men are on edge. The other night one of them died in his sleep and, well, he came back. A ghoulish, growling beast that killed three men before anyone even knew what was happening.%SPEECH_OFF%You rub your chin, remarking you needed a good shave anyway. %employer% nods with a grin.%SPEECH_ON%Mmm, that's what I like you, sellsword. Always in good spirit. Look at this map I have. See these spots? '%objective1%' and '%objective2%' the peasantry calls them. We have reason to believe that both are incredible sources of power fueling the undead hordes. I need a man of your stature and resolve to go there and destroy them. Does this interest you, mercenary?%SPEECH_OFF% | You find %employer% leaning back in his chair. He throws you a map.%SPEECH_ON%Read it, study it. See '%objective1%' and '%objective2%'? My spies believe they are home to incredible powers that are fueling the undead. I think they're just home to a lot of dead bodies for the undead to reincarnate.

You hope %objective2% will be easier to sort out, but you doubt it. | Brigands scour the field picking up the loot which you and their leader agreed would be their share.

After divvying up the goods with the brigands, you prepare to head toward %objective2%, being sure not to tell the thieves of it. | As the last of the undead are put to rest, you get a sense that the air is clearing up, like a fog of smoky air giving way to crisp, springtime aromas. The quick change in scents no doubt means you've cleaned whatever evil dwelled there. You divide the loot with the brigands. They're rather smarmy, claiming the lot of you would not have survived if they weren't there. You almost told them of %objective2%, but this outbreak of ill-placed pride ruins any chance of you ever working with them again. | The evil of the place has been put to rest. %objective2% awaits.\n\n You divvy up the loot with the brigands who are more than happy to do business with you. They don't say it, but it's readily obvious they would have been slaughtered to the last man had you not been there. | With the horrid place cleansed of evil, only %objective2% remains on the contract. As for the brigands, they take their loot as agreed upon. They ask where you're going and you tell them it's none of their business. | As the last wiederganger is put to rest, you feel a sudden change in the air.

Wiedergangers and the oddities of more ancient undead litter the field. The brigands you teamed up with are combing through the remains, taking their share of the loot as agreed upon. You hope %objective2% will be easier to sort out, but you doubt it. | Brigands scour the field picking up the loot which you and their leader agreed would be their share. You tell %randombrother% to quietly get the men ready for the march to %objective2%. He asks why quietly and you respond.%SPEECH_ON%Because the last thing we need are these useless ratfark anchors showing up in another battle and taking loot we both know they did not earn.%SPEECH_OFF%The sellsword nods.%SPEECH_ON%Ah.
