I need a man of your, eh, steely stature to go there and put an end to both spots. Hopefully it is something that interests you.%SPEECH_OFF% | %employer% welcomes you into his room, but a guard checks your throat with the blade of a polearm. You keep calm as the nobleman quickly orders his man to stand down. The nobleman apologizes.%SPEECH_ON%Sorry for that unfortunate event, but the men are on edge. The other night one of them died in his sleep and, well, he came back. A ghoulish, growling beast that killed three men before anyone even knew what was happening.%SPEECH_OFF%You rub your chin, remarking you needed a good shave anyway. %employer% nods with a grin.%SPEECH_ON%Mmm, that's what I like you, sellsword. Always in good spirit. Look at this map I have. See these spots? '%objective1%' and '%objective2%' the peasantry calls them. We have reason to believe that both are incredible sources of power fueling the undead hordes. I need a man of your stature and resolve to go there and destroy them. Does this interest you, mercenary?%SPEECH_OFF% | You find %employer% leaning back in his chair. He throws you a map.%SPEECH_ON%Read it, study it. See '%objective1%' and '%objective2%'? My spies believe they are home to incredible powers that are fueling the undead. I think they're just home to a lot of dead bodies for the undead to reincarnate.

After divvying up the goods with the brigands, you prepare to head toward %objective2%, being sure not to tell the thieves of it. | As the last of the undead are put to rest, you get a sense that the air is clearing up, like a fog of smoky air giving way to crisp, springtime aromas. The quick change in scents no doubt means you've cleaned whatever evil dwelled there. You divide the loot with the brigands. They're rather smarmy, claiming the lot of you would not have survived if they weren't there. You almost told them of %objective2%, but this outbreak of ill-placed pride ruins any chance of you ever working with them again. | The evil of the place has been put to rest. %objective2% awaits.\n\n You divvy up the loot with the brigands who are more than happy to do business with you. They don't say it, but it's readily obvious they would have been slaughtered to the last man had you not been there. | With the horrid place cleansed of evil, only %objective2% remains on the contract. As for the brigands, they take their loot as agreed upon. They ask where you're going and you tell them it's none of their business. | As the last wiederganger is put to rest, you feel a sudden change in the air. Cleanliness punches your lungs with unexpected clarity as you stand in a world of muck and mire. %randombrother% wipes his brow.%SPEECH_ON%Must be the end of it. On our way to %objective2% then?%SPEECH_OFF%As a brigand walks up, you tell the mercenary to hush. Best not to inform the bastards of the next spot. Despite taking a large share of loot, they were hardly a good goddam bit of help in the fight. | You entered a domain of evil, but with the last wiederganger slain you see the light of the world brighten and the smell of the earth beneath your feet returns to the natural order. With this place laid to rest, it's time to go on to %objective2%.\n\n The leader of the brigands comes up. He's got a scroll in hand and is keeping a tab of the divvied loot.%SPEECH_ON%Happy working with ya, sellsword.%SPEECH_OFF%You tell him that his band of idiot men would have blundered to their doom had you not shown up. He shrugs.%SPEECH_ON%Nobody's perfect. Until next time, then?%SPEECH_OFF%You ignore him to go gather the men. | The victory was hard fought. Wiedergangers and the oddities of more ancient undead litter the field. The brigands you teamed up with are combing through the remains, taking their share of the loot as agreed upon. You hope %objective2% will be easier to sort out, but you doubt it. | Brigands scour the field picking up the loot which you and their leader agreed would be their share. You tell %randombrother% to quietly get the men ready for the march to %objective2%. He asks why quietly and you respond.%SPEECH_ON%Because the last thing we need are these useless ratfark anchors showing up in another battle and taking loot we both know they did not earn.%SPEECH_OFF%The sellsword nods.%SPEECH_ON%Ah. I'd say you took the words right of my mouth, but you got a bit creative there in the hatred, sir.%SPEECH_OFF% | You start readying the men for the march to %objective2%.\n\n The brigand' leader comes to you.%SPEECH_ON%Good fightin' with ya. Say, where are you off ta next? More treasures to find, eh?%SPEECH_OFF%You turn and grab the man by his shirt.%SPEECH_ON%I think we both know which of us pulled their weight in that fight. Now, you take your loot and go. That's what we agreed upon. If you follow us, I'll melt everything you've pilfered and pour it over your goddam head, got it?%SPEECH_OFF%He shrinks back, nodding anxiously as though you might follow up on that promise just this second. | With the last of the undead slain, you look about the field. The dead are not of one source, judging by their variety of clothes and armors, but they are not of one timeline either. Some wear the armors of ancients and carried disturbing uniformity in their efforts to kill.\n\n %randombrother% comes by, stating that the company is ready to move onto %objective2% whenever you are. The brigand' leader interrupts.%SPEECH_ON%Well, whenever we divvy up the loot first, right?%SPEECH_OFF%You nod. That is what was agreed upon.}\""
