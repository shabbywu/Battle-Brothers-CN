You thank the messenger, but he says nothing, simply turning and stilting his way down the road. | While walking down %townname%'s road, a few men cry out from a local tavern, howling with laughter as they wave you over. Snickering and doubling over, they can barely spit out their news: apparently some nobleman has been looking for a sellsword. Interesting, but you can't help but ask why they were laughing. The men go silent for a moment and one shrugs while another coughs out an answer.%SPEECH_ON%Because we're drunk?%SPEECH_OFF%The men keep a strained set of straight faces for but a second longer before bursting into laughter once more. | A servant of a local noble asks you to follow him on his master's behest. He leads you into the wealthier part of %townname%, where the buildings get taller and the people streets don't reek of horse manure. Eventually you reach a manor that looks as if it used to be a temple. Fake owls dot the eaves, staring you down as you walk by. A depressed-looking cat idles on the front steps. You enter through a front door that squalls with opulence, its hinges and wide swing echoing into the foyer. Your mouth drops open as you hardly even know the words to describe the grandeur inside.}\""
