Resisting, you pick up a crown. His hands drop and he jerks his head up, glaring at you. Slowly, you put the coin down and then produce a stick with a string wrapped around its top. His stare slackens, the sturdy stick a slick treat to the unkempt wildman. You motion that you'll give it to him in exchange for the crowns. He takes the stick. You take the crowns.\\n\\n But when the wildman plays with the string, it falls off and blows away in the wind. He cries out, then stares murderously at you, yourself standing there with both arms barreled to try and hold all the crowns. The wildman screams. You drop the crowns and run as fast as you can. There is all manner of chaos going on behind you - tools and weapons being broke, brothers running for their lives, and the absolute bedlam of a bunch of confused men beset by a wildman - but you dare not look.",

He leans back from his moneyed manifestations with a wide grin, but then suddenly launches forward, knocking the towers over like a child would their blocks. He laughs maniacally as the coins scatter. The man playing with his money is a curious sight. Perhaps the wildman has no real conception of what crowns are good for? If so, maybe... maybe you could take them back?",
