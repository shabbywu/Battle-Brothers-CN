The men are enjoying some beer and food when rather suddenly the shouts of two men in particular get everyone else to quiet down, not because they yell louder than the rest, but because it's rather out of character for the both of them: the monks %monk1% and %monk2% are screaming-deep in a theological debate.\\n\\nYou've not the education to understand the intricacies nor complexities of what they are arguing, but you do understand that getting into another man's face and pointing furiously at him, or at a holy book, is probably asking for trouble one way or another.",

It's just what they do. So you decide to let the men hash it out. In time, their voices lower in volume, and their faces lower together into a book. They quietly peruse it, bumping heads as they draw their eyes over the pages. Finally, %monk1% raises up, pointing to some sentence.%SPEECH_ON%There! Right there! 'Man from mud', not 'man from blood'. Man can't be from blood, he is blood! Man can't be from himself, see? Now does it make sense?%SPEECH_OFF%Scratching his chin, %monk2% nods, but then wonders aloud.%SPEECH_ON%What if...%SPEECH_OFF%Before he can even finish the thought %monk1% slaps the book closed and throws his hands into the air.",
