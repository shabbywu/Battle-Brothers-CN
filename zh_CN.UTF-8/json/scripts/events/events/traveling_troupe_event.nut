But the playfulness is wiped away when %randombrother% walks up and plants a punch right on his chin. The mime goes down with a catlike cry, mewling in the mud as he nurses his jaw.\n\nThe rest of the company knocks the troupe around while raiding their wagon for goods. A juggler gets kicked right in the balls and a singer has her throat chopped by %randombrother2%'s hand. The sword swallower tries to hide his sword the only place he knows where, but a mercenary retrieves it with a rather painful unsheathing. The firebreather drinks the entirety of his jug then asks if you want to take that, too. You have him gut-punched for his snark.\n\n When it's all said and done, there really isn't much to take as beating up jesters isn't the most profitable business. At least with a busted mouth maybe the mime will do his job better.",

You didn't think it a particularly big cart, but about fifteen men and women inexplicably pour out of its back. Painted faces, musical instruments, juggling balls, longswords for swallowing, wine jugs for firebreathing, the troupe of entertainers fan out and demonstrate mini-talent shows as though you'd already paid for their services. When they finish, they clap, stomp their feet, and freeze before you, hands out, smiles across their faces. A white-faced mime ironically speaks.%SPEECH_ON%What say you, travelers, care for a show?
