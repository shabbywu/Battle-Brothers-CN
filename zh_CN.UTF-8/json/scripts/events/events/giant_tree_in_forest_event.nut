    "original": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_25.png[/img]You pass through a wall of shrubs and find yourself stopped by quite a sight. To call it a tree would seem insulting. The trees about it are so low beneath their neighbor they appear to be bending at midtrunk, swearing fealty to that which is arboreally suzerain, a domain rippled with roots as thick as any man, and enough shade above to lose time between the days and night.\n\n You walk to the base of the enormity and run a hand along its bark, but then you stop, fearing that your flesh may have just trespassed upon holy ground like a child tumbling playfully into a church of one wholly quiet crowd. %monk% the monk comes to your side nodding and with his hands firmly behind his back.%SPEECH_ON%This is a godtree. The roots go through the earth and into the realm of the gods. It is said they once listened, but now... we are not so sure.%SPEECH_OFF%You stare at the man, and his particularly withheld posture, and ask if he fears the tree. He smiles at you and shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%I respect it like a man would the sea, for the waters of the oceans hold many things to fear and, yet, the sailor sails anyway. Were the ocean a docile beast, would man refer to it so lovingly?%SPEECH_OFF%",
    "translation": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_25.png[/img]你穿过一道茂密的灌木丛，被眼前的景象所震惊。 若是把眼前的这个东西仅仅叫做一棵树或许对它是一种冒犯。 这周围的林木都朝着中心弯下腰，似是在向这树中的宗主表示敬意，那巨木粗壮的根系暴露在地面上，每一根分叉都足有你的腰那么粗，其头顶绿茵遮天蔽日，你甚至无法分清这是白天还是夜晚。\n\n 你走到树干旁边，用手掌轻轻抚过树皮，但又立刻停下来，因为你意识到此时的行为或许与无知顽童闯进肃穆教堂一般无异。僧侣 %monk% 背着手慢悠悠地走过来。%SPEECH_ON%这是一棵有灵的神树。 其根系洞穿我们脚下的厚土，联通神灵的领域。 据说神灵也曾侧耳聆听尘世众生，不过现在…现在的事谁又说得清楚呢。%SPEECH_OFF%你盯着这个人，他的站姿格外矜持，于是你问他对这棵树是否畏惧。 他微笑着摇摇头。%SPEECH_ON%我对它怀有敬意，就像一个人面对着汪洋大海，那阴郁深沉的洋面下掩藏着不知多少值得畏惧的东西，但水手无论如何都还在航行。 要是连大海都变得温顺驯良，人们又何必对它怀有敬畏之心呢？%SPEECH_OFF%",
