You turn round to see the rest of the men looking as confused as you are. Holding your fist up to quiet the company, the forest returns your order of silence with muted chirps of distant birds and the buzz of a bee or wasp somewhere unseen. Shaking your head, you decide to continue the march.\n\nA few hours later, the wildman jumps out of a bush you were about to cleave with a machete. He's got an armful of random items in hand. Where he got these things, you've no idea, but you have the men sift through the findings. %wildman% returns to rank as though nothing happened at all. You glance at the man and catch him staring at a butterfly on his finger. When you glance at him again, the butterfly is gone and the man is swallowing something. %otherguy% gives you a report on what he brought.",
