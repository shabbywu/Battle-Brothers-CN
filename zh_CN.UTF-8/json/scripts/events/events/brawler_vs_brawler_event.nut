You think you could take me?%SPEECH_OFF%The other brawler, %brawler2%, jumps to his feet.%SPEECH_ON%Take you? I could put ya under the ground ya farkin' pillowfisted fool!%SPEECH_OFF%The slightest suggestion that %brawler%'s fists weren't made of jaw-demolishing bricks kicks off a brutal fight. The brawlers grab one another and swing their free hands in looping undercuts. Each punch lands with cracking ferocity. Surely no man could take so much damage and stay on his feet, but here you're witnessing two fellas doing just that. You order the company to break up the fight.\n\n%brawler% pinches a nostril and shoots blood out of the other.
