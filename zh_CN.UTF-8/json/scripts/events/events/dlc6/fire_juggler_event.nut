He lowers a torch down and one of the villagers lights it, but when the jester pulls the torch up the villager pretends to throw their own fire into the vat of oil. The juggler jerks away momentarily and the crowd laughs as the bemused jester laughs.\n\n When the jester starts his act, he begins with setting himself on fire. Literally the first torch slips his hand and goes right into the vat which launches a plume of flame from which there is no discerning between man and fire aside from the hellish screams. He scrambles off the 'stage' and the crowd only rears back to point and laugh. When he is dead, his crowns are taken by one of the residents. They lift the gold to the sky, make a passing mention of the Gilded one, then dump the crowns into the flames. His body is left for the dogs. After all is said and done, you kick around in the ashes and find a plate of melted gold. Not exactly of much value, but it's gotta be worth something and you take it when no one - not even the dogs - are looking.}\""
