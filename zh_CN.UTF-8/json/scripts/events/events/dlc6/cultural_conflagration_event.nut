    "translation": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_175.png[/img]{吼叫声把你从整理库存中引开。 你看到几个人在篝火的另一边用手指或者武器指来指去。 看起来是一场关于哪里的女人更漂亮的骚动：南方人或北方人。 讽刺的是，北方人投给南方女人，南方人投给北方女人。 几声严厉的指令让队伍恢复了秩序，但是局势依旧紧张。 | 队伍里一些人有点拳脚摩擦。 很显然，是关于男女婚礼的矛盾。 北方人相信应该是一夫一妻制，而南方人倾向于越多女人越好。 你告诉他们停止像个娘们一样打架并集中注意力到工作上，这个工作后是否拿着报酬去花在一个还是很多个女人身上你一点都不关心。 | 几个手下因为一些宗教差异发作了。 旧神与镀金者的冲突，每一个人都好像个信仰大使似的，外交官风格的把拳头移到另一边的脸上。 你告诉他们停下清净会儿。 如果他们想争论哪个神最好，他们可以到来生再去争论。 | 几个人在争吵，听起来是因为，额…沙子？ 看起来队伍里的北方人在开南方人的玩笑，问他们人得有多蠢才会住在一片只有沙子的土地上。%SPEECH_ON%谁会环顾着一片烫屁屁的沙丘时向着，啊，我要在这安家。 我怀疑你们儿的祖先有足够清晰的意识来认识到这个世界不止有没完没了的日照。%SPEECH_OFF%这引来了第一拳。 扭打让几个人受了点伤，但你让手下恢复了秩序，命令他们有什么地理意见都憋着。 | 一场争论因战团中的南方人嘲笑他们的北方兄弟缺少谈吐教养爆发了。 其中一个用他的双手在他的耳边展开。%SPEECH_ON%我们都是这样说话的，是的，是先生，俺们伙计们一起整点婊子活？俺俺俺们－%SPEECH_OFF%拳脚中断了玩笑。 几个人在交手中有点擦伤，但你在事态更严重之前制止了他们。 | 尽管通常对他们的领主不屑一顾，北方人和南方人开始捍卫他们各自的领主和大臣们。 看起来文化对立激起了一些从前没见过的忠诚感。 争论发展成一场实际的拳击，当然边上没有什么可以让他们给留下好印象的领主。 你分开他们，告诉他们应该多给你和身边的战友留点好印象。}",
