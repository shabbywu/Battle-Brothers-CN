He cocks an arm back. That... that is not what you wanted to see. He sizes up the beehive, tongue out, eyes slimmed. You rush forward, yelling at him, but he's already honed in. He launches a fist and absolutely obliterates the bees. Honeycombs stickily flail around his wrist as though his hairy arm were an impromptu maypole. The Wildman casually walks back down the sand dune.
