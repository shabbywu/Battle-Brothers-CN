Immediately, you test if you can pull some of the gold away, but it has no give. %randombrother% calls you over to a slab of stone which is gapped. Perhaps a belltower at one point? Light fades quick and you can see very little inside. Above the entryway a relief depicts men pulling carts of scrolls.\\n\\n There's a set of words repeatedly scrawled across the relief. None of the languages look remotely familiar to anything you've ever heard or seen. It takes a bit of time until you can find a hurriedly etched translation left by someone approximal to your era: 'the Library, the Labyrinth of the Night, the Labyrinth of the Mind, Leave here as you would Leave a Dream, Tread here as you would Tread a Dream, Leave to Dwell upon the Horror of not Knowing, Enter to be One with Knowing, and in Knowing the Dream, Know the Nightmare'.%SPEECH_ON%Fair bit ominous, captain, but if you wanna go down in there we got the rope and torches to see to it.%SPEECH_OFF%%randombrother% tells you this, and the look on his face suggests he's hoping you decline the proposition.}",

But it is only the torso which is ensconced. You stare at the phylacteries and they are brimming with energy now, and in staring you can see the ghostly faces smearing along the glass like streaks of rain. You hear a loud clap and turn back to see the Loremaster in full, its eyes aflame with white fire, its limbs skinny yet with smoky muscles winding around its frame, and its lower half is pluming with black ash as it glides forward.
