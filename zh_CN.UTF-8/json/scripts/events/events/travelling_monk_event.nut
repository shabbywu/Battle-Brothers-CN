Broomstraw and virid moss are strung up to one side of the cart, both twisting eagerly in the very winds that dried them, and some pots and pans clatter like rustic windchimes as the modest wares come to a bumbling stop. A barrel totters on the edge of the cart's bed and a couple of bees sway to keep up, poking and prodding at its cracks with thirsty curiosity.\n\nThe monk lifts a wool hat up out of his face but the lip of it folds back down over his eyes.
