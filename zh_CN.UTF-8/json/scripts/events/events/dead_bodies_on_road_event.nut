    "original": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img] {A wagon, tipped over. Dead horses by its side. One dead donkey with evidence of having put up a fight. Women. Children. A couple of older men. Most mutilated in a fashion unsuitable for being found by anyone, but you figure your company was probably the best fit to come across such ruin. You've got the stomach for it, for you have created worse. It is the innocence of the dead that turns the gut, though, and in a feeble effort to rectify that moral illness you go ahead and bury the dead. Sadly, nothing of value is found in their remains. | Blood in the ditch by the side of the road. Blood all across the road. Blood in the ditch on the other side of the road. Blood up on the canvas of the wagon. Blood in the dead's eyes and blood in their mouth. One poor farmer, deceased, seemingly happened upon by a band of thieves for nothing of value he carried remains in the ruin you've stumbled upon. | The birds were the first hint: cycling and turning over a distant calamity. You figured whatever they saw was still alive, but by the time you got to it the flock had landed and you stumbled across a dead man leaning up against a sidepost.\n\nYou try and scare the birds away. The black buzzards only hop a few steps in the opposite direction where they then turn to stare at you. The corpse is fresh, the means to its death a slow one: a few arrows stick out of his side. A rope on his hip suggests he had a purse there. Someone robbed him - twice. | You stumble across a few hanged criminals. They swing from a tree by the side of the road, their faces mere impressions beneath the woolsacks over their heads. A few of them show signs of torture: gashes here and there, the glaring muscles turning purple and some already grey. Blood beneath one's feet, suggesting someone had a go at him while he suffocated. Naturally, they have nothing of value so you get back on the road. | A goat with a bell cradled in the arms of a dead shepherd. You found the pair by the side of the road. The animal's throat is open, and the man's body has no wounds. Maybe he died of a broken heart. %randombrother% rifles through the dead man's pockets and comes up empty handed. You decide to leave the two where they were. | Two buzzards clasp a string of intestine between the two of them, slowly chomping it down until their beaks clack together. You'd be humored if it weren't for where this meal had come from: a dead child, he or she lying face down on the ground. The back had been torn away, a lurid ribcage glistening in the sun.\n\nYou scare off the birds - though they are quite reluctant to be scared at all - and then bury the body. Moving back onto the road, you see the two birds squatting over the grave, picking and prodding at the dirt {in some sort of avian angst | as if to somehow recreate the process they'd seen but in reverse}. Giving up, they eventually take flight, circling above your band of men for a mile or two before heading elsewhere. | The fires crackle and pop as they consume the last of the wagon. %randombrother% picks through the blackened mess, but comes up empty handed. A few hands can be found sticking up out of the ash and soot, their forms as equally black. The bodies are completely gone, buried or burned away or buried beneath that which was burned away. Seeing as how there is nothing to salvage, you quickly get the company back on the road. | A dead horse. Its rider is across the road, having crawled to his final resting spot. Broken arrows litter the path, the heads of them ripped off and salvaged. The man is missing his scalp, the cap of his head glinting and red. After a quick search you realize there's nothing here to take and decide to move on. | You come across a pile of naked bodies by the side of the road. Some of them look ghastly, as though they've been dead for a great long while, though rather fresh blood is in some of their mouths. A few of the corpses carry color in their flesh, but they have what look like bite marks here and there. Preemptive measures were taken, it seems, for every one of them has had his or her neck slashed. Naked as they are, you naturally find nothing but what is natural to nature itself. You move on. | You feel as though you are being stared at and stop, quickly turning to the side of the road with a hand on your sword. A head stares back at you with its eyes barely peeping over some grass. %randombrother% walks over and picks it up. The face carries the visage of a rather jarring death, being so slackjawed and slanted. You tell the sellsword to put the head down for you've better things to do.}",
    "translation": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img] {一辆载重货车，翻倒了。 它旁边有几匹死马。 一头死驴，有打斗的迹象。 女人们。孩子们。几个老人。 大部分都残肢断臂，对于发现他们的人来说是一场恶心的视觉盛宴，你确信你的战团是最优秀的，能够应付这种恶心的场面。 你让你的胃忍住不吐，因为你让它变糟了。 这些无辜的死者肠穿肚烂，然而，在无力纠正这种道德疾病的情况下，你只能继续埋葬这些死者。 遗憾的是，在他们的遗体中没有发现任何有价值的东西。 | 路边的水沟里有血。 路上到处都是血。 路另一边的水沟里也有血。 鲜血染红了载重货车的帆布。 死者眼睛和嘴里都是血。 一个可怜的农夫，死了，似乎还被一群贼洗劫了，因为这具被你偶然发现的遗骸没剩下任何有价值的东西了。 | 鸟群是第一个暗示：见到或遇到一个遥远的灾难。 你以为他们看到的东西还活着，但当你走到那儿的时候，鸟群已经降落了，你无意中发现一个靠在石头上的死人。\n\n你试着把鸟吓跑。 这些黑秃鹫们只会朝着相反的方向跳几步，然后就会转向盯着你看。 尸体是新鲜的，死亡的方式是缓慢的：几支箭从他的侧面扎出来。 他屁股上的绳子表明他有个钱包。 有人抢劫了他－不止两次。 | 你偶然发现一些被绞死的罪犯。 他们在路边的一棵树上荡来荡去，他们的脸在头上的羊毛布袋下仅仅显出轮廓。 他们中的一些人显现出受折磨的迹象：到处都是伤痕，强壮的肌肉变成了紫色，有些已经是灰色了。 脚底下有血，表明他窒息时有人对他动过手脚。 当然，他们没有任何价值，所以你又回到了路上。 | 一只带着铃铛的山羊被一个死去的牧羊人抱着。 你在路边找到了他们。 动物的喉咙是割开的，人的身体没有伤口。 也许牧羊人死于心脏病。%randombrother% 开始搜死者的口袋，空手而归。 你决定把它们的尸体留在原地。 | 两只秃鹰撕扯着一段肠子，慢慢地咀嚼着，直到它们的喙咔嗒咔嗒地碰到一起。 你被这顿饭的来历惊呆了：一个死去的孩子，他或她脸朝下躺在地上。 他的背部被撕裂了，一个可怕的胸腔在阳光下闪闪发光。\n\n你吓跑了那些鸟－尽管它们很不愿意被吓到－然后把尸体埋起来。 回到路上，你看到两只鸟儿蹲在坟墓上，{ 焦虑地在泥土中啄来啄去 | 在泥土中啄来啄去就像是想把坟墓挖出来一样}。 放弃后，它们最终会飞走，在你的队伍上空盘旋一两英里，然后飞向别处。 | 篝火噼噼啪啪地燃烧着，吞噬着一辆载重货车。%randombrother% 在一片漆黑的废墟中搜寻，却空手而归。 你可以看到有几只手从灰烬和煤烟中伸出来，它们的外表也一样黑。 尸体完全不见了，被埋了，被烧了，或者被烧完后埋了。 看到没有任何东西可以挽救，你很快让战团回到路上。 | 一匹死马。它的骑手穿过了大路，爬到了他最后的休息地点。 破碎的箭散布在小径上，它们的头被扯下来捡走了。 这名男子的头皮不见了，他的头顶反射着光。 在快速搜索之后，你意识到这里没有什么可以带走的，于是决定继续前进。 | 你在路边看到一堆裸体。 有些人看起来很可怕，好像他们已经死了很久了，虽然有些人嘴里还流着新鲜的血。 一些尸体身上被涂了颜色，但它们到处都有咬痕。 似乎是被采取了先发制人的措施，因为每个人的脖子都被割过。 他们一丝不挂，你自然只会发现它们原有的东西。你继续前进。 | 你觉得自己好像被人盯着，然后停了下来，迅速转向路边，一只手按在剑上。 一个人头盯着你，它的眼睛几乎没有从草上探出来。%randombrother% 走过去把它捡起来。 这张脸长的口眼歪斜，带着一种相当不和谐的死亡表情。 你告诉佣兵放下这个头，因为你有重要的事情要做。}",
