The wood cricks and cracks when bent, the string frizzes and goes wiry every time you draw it back, and you swear you saw a termite poking its head out of the shaft. Every tested arrow goes haywire, skirting this way or that, anywhere but its supposed target.\n\nYou ease the bowyer's pain by blaming yourself for how inaccurate the weapon is, but %otherguy1% and %otherguy2% both give it a try and come to even worse results. The bowyer eventually shuffles off, cradling his construction in his arms before tossing it onto the stockpile of weapons where you'd wish it'd look just like any other bow, but its obscene ugliness makes it stick out like a hot coal on a haystack. Surely no man will be accidentally wielding that thing!",
