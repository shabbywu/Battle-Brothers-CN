There you see the historian's sloppy scribblings. His notes are in a language you can't read, but you can easily follow the arrows he's drawn over the pages to connect segments together. He then unfurls another scroll, a fresh one, with all the translations.%SPEECH_ON%These are old training manuals. They speak of techniques I never knew existed.

You see a spiraling darkness wreathed in living shadows, the screaming specters of creatures that still yet yearn for finality in death, and amongst them swirl beings, grinning and yapping, like bestial puppet masters, maws slipped to yonder depths, their boned teeth the only light in this realm, their smiles but crescents of ill-shaped moons come to feast on the stars themselves.%SPEECH_ON%Oh naive one, does thou think Davkul does not listen?%SPEECH_OFF%You suddenly awake to %historian%'s screams.

We did not think you would survive this long, and indeed it has been long since our services were called upon.%SPEECH_OFF%Lithe, hip-swaying creatures slip so lightly into the tent as though they were hardly more than the wind itself. Outside, you can hear the murmur of the rest of the company being overcome by the seductive beings. One walks toward you, her shape flashing between all the women of your life, testing your response, and when your heart warms it settles on a young lady that once broke your heart. The succubus falls atop you.%SPEECH_ON%Don't mind me, human, this is for you. Relax.%SPEECH_OFF%You let the pleasures wash over you.\n\n Immeasurable hours later you awake with your trousers down and %historian% in the corner rubbing his head.%SPEECH_ON%They were so wonderful, but the scroll's gone.
