He walks through the crowd to the prisoner. They talk. He whispers, the prisoner nods. When they finish, the %cultist% nods to the crowd of cultists. One member steps forward, disrobes, and pitches himself into the fire, screamless and without protest. Another cultist pitches a rake into the flames, tearing something out of it and handing it over to %cultist%. The prisoner, his life ostensibly spared in an exchange, is freed and you watch as %cultist% grabs him and takes him back up the hill. He pushes the man forward as he speaks.%SPEECH_ON%You have taken from Davkul, but the debt is paid.%SPEECH_OFF%You ask what it is he has in his hand. The cultist holds up what had been retrieved from the flames. It is a skull patched over in leathered flesh, and stretched taut over its face is a freshly singed visage, presumably of the man who had tossed himself into the fire. Slight hints of his face twist and turn, his mouth wringed ajar, misshapen by a cruel and murmuring darkness. Still holding it aloft like a native showing off a prized scalp, %cultist% speaks bluntly.%SPEECH_ON%Davkul awaits us all.%SPEECH_OFF%",

    "original": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_140.png[/img]You decide to wait and see what happens. The bonfire's face returns, a great magmatic maw opening up as the chained man is pushed forward. He screams and bends backward, but it's no use. His clothes burn away and the tatters fly backward in flailing orange ruin. His skin peels as though it were not fire, but a thousand scalpels running across his body. By sharpened white fire he is flayed. His skull is bored out, wriggling and shaking like a snake shedding its skin, and his eyes remain forever seeing though the rest of his body is stripped away by flesh and organs and bones. When he is but a skull with eyes, the face in the fire closes its mouth and the great howls of the sacrifice come to a snapping silence. The bonfire dies out in an instant, and the man, or what's left of him, falls to the earth. The eyes burn bright, slowly fading like a cooling hot iron.\n\n One of the cultists bends down and picks up the skull. He easily cracks it in half, dropping the brainpan while holding onto what used to be a face. As he holds the remains outward, the bones blacken and invert, creating a cruel visage of utter darkness wreathed by a rim of bone. He puts it on and begins to leave.",
