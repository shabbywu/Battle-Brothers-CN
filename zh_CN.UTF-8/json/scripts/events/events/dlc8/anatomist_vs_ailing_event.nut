As time goes on, you need to get the company back on the road and %anatomist% still hasn't come out of the tent. You go over and peek in.\n\nYou find the anatomist sitting on a stool off to the side. He has one arm slung across a table with the hand scratching back and forth in mad notetaking. His other arm is slack between his legs, his thumb and finger pressing together now and again in a strange pinching motion that seems to be counting the seconds.

Much, much better.
