You can see strings of rope attached to their shoulders, and far above them fly black kites which twirl and whirl as though he'd seen to himself a puppet of his own construction. His face looks the sort of man to make such a thing, a twist of madness, sneering with some joke that he thought of years ago and never stopped laughing about. His dark complexion is not usual to the north, and when he speaks he knows your tongue.%SPEECH_ON%You've oddities on you, good smelling oddities at that. What is that, though, what is it? It is not meat. It is not tender human meat. It is not meat of the birds, nor of the pups that go under the ice. It, well, is it even meat at all? Oh my, that is incense! Look, lemme have a whiff of that sweet spice and I'll give you something in return for it. Just a little sniff, that's all, I'll even pay for it.%SPEECH_OFF%You put your hand on your sword.}",

My wife, your mother, %bellydancer%, how is she?%SPEECH_OFF%The belly dancer's smile fades. He mentions that she held out hope for as long as she could. The kite-kitted man nods solemnly, but also expectedly. He says it wouldn't be right for her to be married to a specter of what once was, and that he himself, with no hope of making a return home, moved on as well.

Curious, you ask him why the kites. He responds that they are tools of fear meant to ward off dangerous animals and the like, including the more superstitious of the barbarians.
