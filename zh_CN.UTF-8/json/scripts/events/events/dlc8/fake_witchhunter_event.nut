If he decided not to kill her, and the village rescinded its agreement, then he'd later be compelled to simply do the bidding of every village to prevent that situation from happening again. Through a series of gentle explanations you show that the village is in danger of displaying for all that it is untrustworthy, and that by the virtue of the example it sets it will only be set upon by charlatans and miscreants with aims on their gold and not on completing a task as asked. And, if anything, the hunter's refusal to burn an innocent shows the strength of his character.\n\nWhen you're finished, the crowd mostly agrees, but then someone says 'burn him anyway!' and everyone roars back into a rage.
