    "original": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_43.png[/img]{Despite the noise of the surrounding villagers and their commerce, %anatomist% opens up a book of dissections and starts poring through its contents. While a local peasant might not be able to read the texts, he can absolutely see the disgusting images drawn on the pages: lurid documentation of opened bodies, identifications of body parts the peasant didn't even know he had, and a number of inane symbolism that any layman would use to invite his own devilments. Unsurprisingly, the peasant takes an interest in the anatomist's tome.%SPEECH_ON%So are you some sort of sorcerer or something?%SPEECH_OFF%Smiling, %anatomist% turns and says if the peasant thought that was remotely true, would he ever ask it of him? The peasant leans back.%SPEECH_ON%Oh, so yer a wiseacre, huh? Some smartass with a book for fools.%SPEECH_OFF%%anatomist% watches the peasant turn and leave, then looks at you with a wide grin.%SPEECH_ON%That peasant had a curious bulge on his cheek. He'll be dead within a year. Two if he's unlucky and death is too generous with its time.%SPEECH_OFF% | Taking a break from the road and sellswording, %anatomist% sets down on a stone and opens up one of his books. A few moments into his studies, a little girl approaches, flowers in hand. She hands him one and asks what it is he's reading. The anatomist holds up his book and turns it around. She stares at the grisly drawings of beasts and monsters ripped open and their curious insides churned out. After a pause, she slowly pushes the book down to stare at the anatomist holding it. She says.%SPEECH_ON%I know of a beast you could have.%SPEECH_OFF%You and the anatomist turn a keen ear. The little girl lowers her voice, nearly hissing with childlike conspiracy.%SPEECH_ON%My little brother. He's two, but I swear he forsakes the old gods and the devilry is in him.%SPEECH_OFF%%anatomist% nods dutifully.%SPEECH_ON%But of course. I will put it in my notes to see to this matter, and if I have time I will find the foulness within your kin.%SPEECH_OFF%The little girl thanks the anatomist once more and gives him more flowers for his promised aid. %anatomist% holds the flowers softly, rolling them back and forth as he goes back to his reading, a small smile on his face. You're hoping that the smile is just an indicator that he's bemused by a child, and not that he actually wishes to see to some ungodly boy. | As the company takes a rest, a man stands off at the side of the path, watching curiously. He nods.%SPEECH_ON%You lot have the stench of death about you, but I can't say I'd take ye for butcherers or executioners. Yer something else entire.%SPEECH_OFF%Without missing a beat, %anatomist% steps up and eyes the man, getting right up in his face, and the man leans away, but doesn't retreat. The anatomist's lost gaze ends with a dutiful nod.%SPEECH_ON%You are right, we do carry a stench, as do you. Ours is a matter of science, yours a matter of disease. And yours, hmm, yes, yours is a hint of the pox. Lemme see your feet.%SPEECH_OFF%The peasant nervously declines the request. He steps back as the anatomist hunts forward, fingers clambering like a spider, his eyes wide. The man eventually screams and runs off. %anatomist% turns around with a smile.%SPEECH_ON%What a curious subject, that man. I believe he was very, very ill, but he does not yet know it. Oh well.%SPEECH_OFF% | You come across an open-air wagon carrying a casket, its pathing trailed by a retinue of mourners. %anatomist% steps out from the company and inquires about the death of the individual. They said it was from a beast's strike. Curious, the anatomist inquires what sort of beast would be capable killing a man. The people look at one another before opening the coffin to reveal a man with a small scratch across his cheek. The wound had long since turned dark purple with veins of green and other disturbing discoloration, evidence that his demise was one of being stricken. One of the peasants looks up.%SPEECH_ON%It was his housecat that did it. Nicked him right there, and he paid little mind to it, then the colors went out and wandered his flesh until he was dead within two nights.%SPEECH_OFF%The anatomist shares some words with the mourners then returns to you. He sighs.%SPEECH_ON%T'was a simple blighting. All he needed to do was clean the cut. Unfortunate, though I am happy that my learnings are giving me real world insights, even if it is too late to apply them.%SPEECH_OFF%You ask what came of the cat. The anatomist nods and says it was in the coffin with its victim, the feline 'beast' tucked there seemingly unawares of its final destination.}",
    "translation": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_43.png[/img]{尽管周围村民和商贩的喧闹声不断，%anatomist%(解剖学家)却翻开了一本解剖学的书籍，专注地阅读内容。尽管当地的农民可能看不懂这些文字，但他却可以看到页面上画的恶心图片：揭开身体内部的细节、标识身体部位。这些似乎是百姓无法理解的符号，甚至可能导致自己的灾难。毫不奇怪，农民对解剖学家的书产生了兴趣。%SPEECH_ON%于是，你是一名巫师之类的吗？%SPEECH_OFF%%anatomist%微笑着转过身来，呼之欲出地说，如果农民认为这是真的，他是否会问他呢？农民后退了几步。%SPEECH_ON%哦，所以你是一个聪明人？手里有一本愚人的书？%SPEECH_OFF%%anatomist%看着农民转身离去，然后转过头，面带微笑地看着你。%SPEECH_ON%那个农民脸上有个奇怪的包块。他一年内就会死。如果他不走运，那就是两年。%SPEECH_OFF% | %anatomist%暂停了旅程和佣兵生涯，坐在石头上打开一本书。几分钟后，一个小女孩拿着鲜花走了过来。她递过来一朵花，并问他在读什么。解剖学家抬起书，把它转了一圈。她瞪着野兽和怪物被撕开的可怕图画，以及他们奇特的内脏。停顿了一下，她慢慢地把书推下来，盯着解剖学家。她说。%SPEECH_ON%我知道有一个你可以做的野兽。%SPEECH_OFF%你和解剖学家的耳朵一起变得尖锐。小女孩压低了声音，像个幼小的阴谋家般地轻声说道。%SPEECH_ON%我小弟弟，他两岁，但是我发誓他放弃了旧的信仰，魔鬼进入了他的身体。%SPEECH_OFF%%anatomist%听了以后，很有水平地点了点头。%SPEECH_ON%当然，我会在我的笔记里记录下来，如果有时间我会把那种恶心的东西从你的亲戚身上剜出来。%SPEECH_OFF%小女孩再次感谢解剖学家，并为他的承诺给了他更多的花。%anatomist%轻轻地拿花，左右摆动着，回到了他的阅读中，脸上挂着微笑。你希望他的微笑只是因为他被一个小孩所迷惑，而不是他真的希望看到一些邪恶的母猪。 | 当战团休息的时候，一个人站在路边观察，好奇地注视着。他点头示意。%SPEECH_ON%你们这群人有着死亡的气息，但我不能说你们是屠夫或行刑者。你们是其他的东西。%SPEECH_OFF%毫不迟疑，%anatomist%走到前面，用目光盯着那个人，把他的脸贴了上去，那个人向后倾斜，但没有退缩。解剖学家失神的目光以一个应该的点头结束。%SPEECH_ON%你是对的，我们确实有恶臭，你也有。我们的问题是科学问题，你们的问题是疾病问题。而你的问题，嗯，你的问题是染病的迹象。让我看看你的脚。%SPEECH_OFF%农民紧张地拒绝了这个请求。他后退时，解剖学家向前走去，手指像蜘蛛一样爬动，他的眼睛睁得大大的，那人最终尖叫着逃走。%anatomist%转过头来微笑着说。%SPEECH_ON%多么奇怪的一个研究对象。我相信他非常,非常的生病，但他还没有意识到。没关系。%SPEECH_OFF% | 你看到一个摆放着一个棺材的开放马车，它的后面是一群哀悼的人。%anatomist%从战团中走出来，询问有关该个体死亡的情况。他们说是被野兽击杀的。解剖学家好奇地问，是什么样的野兽能杀死一个人。人们相互看了看，然后打开棺材，里面躺着一个带着小伤疤的男人。伤口早已变成了深紫色，还有绿色和其他令人不安的色斑，证明他的死是因被攻击致死。其中一个农民抬起头来。%SPEECH_ON%是他的家猫干的。他立刻不再关注了，然后颜色消失了，并漫游在他的肉体中，直到他在两个晚上之内死去。%SPEECH_OFF%解剖学家与哀悼者分享了一些话，然后回到了你身边。他叹了口气。%SPEECH_ON%这只是一个简单的写照。他只需要清洗一下伤口就可以了。不幸的是，尽管我很高兴我的研究成果能给我带来现实世界的启示，但现在来应用似乎已经太晚了。%SPEECH_OFF%你问猫的情况如何。解剖学家点点头，说它和它的受害者一起躺在棺材里，那只猫作为一个看似不知道自己最终命运的“野兽”将其藏在那里。}",
