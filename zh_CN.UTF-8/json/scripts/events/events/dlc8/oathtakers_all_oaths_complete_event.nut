You were never certain of what would happen once the First Oathtaker's oaths had been completed, and now that you have completed them, something is dawning on you and the rest of the company: to keep going. Why turn back now? Who wants to go back to the old, unguided life? Moribund and listless, floating through life without purpose? Surely that is not what Young Anselm intended by starting on the Final Path. You tell the men that every Oath has its meaning, and perhaps it is all the Oaths together which form a meaning of their own. The path of the Oathtaker ends when the Oathtaker wishes it to be so.
