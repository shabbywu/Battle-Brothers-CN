He's eating an apple with one hand while the other sets on the pommel of his weapon like an executioner's hand on his lever. He looks down at the guards, casting his eye upon one person at a time, judging each and finding them wanting. He takes another bite of the apple and turns to you.%SPEECH_ON%Is there a problem here, captain?%SPEECH_OFF%One of the guards quickly steps forward, smiling anxiously.%SPEECH_ON%Ah, no problem. We were just, uh, doing our due diligence in a certain matter.%SPEECH_OFF%The hedge knight tosses an apple core over his shoulder and then takes a long stretch, pieces of his armor grinding and clanking against each other. He nods.%SPEECH_ON%And how's that coming along?%SPEECH_OFF%The guards announce that they just finished. The hedge knight grins and says that if a man's time is spent in error, he should be compensated. Swallowing nervously, one of the guards forks over a purse of coins. He apologizes to you for wasting your time. The group of scrawny guards then beat a spooked, backpedaling retreat until they are gone. %hedgeknight% sighs. He says he was waiting on you to give the word. You ask him the word to do what. He produces another apple and crushes it in the ferocious squeeze of his hand. He thumbs one of the chunks into his mouth.%SPEECH_ON%What do you think?%SPEECH_OFF%}\""
