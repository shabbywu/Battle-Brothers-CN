To you, this is nothing more than something of a curiosity, like when a man has a weird neck, huge hands, or a big hammer between his legs. But to %anatomist%, it's something else entirely. He wishes to know how exactly one man can have such sturdy and powerful lungs when his day-to-day life is of little difference compared to those around him.%SPEECH_ON%We're all fighters here, so how did it come to pass that this man can breathe at such a steady rate compared to the rest of us? Surely he contains an element that we do not, and I think I may be able to find that element.%SPEECH_OFF%Wait, 'we' are all fighters here? You wouldn't quite go that far, but you don't correct the anatomist. You ask him how exactly he'd study this matter.%SPEECH_ON%A simple dissection would not be a digression, all things considered, but I believe that %ironlungs% would refuse the request. So, that leaves me with one options, which is to study him intently and see if I can replicate his strengths unto myself through bone manipulation and careful incisions.%SPEECH_OFF%}",

He grits his teeth and commits to another strike. This time a great gush of red spews out.

Eventually, the anatomist convinces the man to step into a tent with him. You keep an eye on the area in case the anatomist loses it and goes into a mad egghead rampage. Eventually, %anatomist% returns with a vial in hand which he swirls around for a time, then drinks. He nods.%SPEECH_ON%Hopefully this may work.

He refused these answers, convincing himself there must be some other way. Then he went full on nutbar with the tools he had and started, uh, 'working' on himself.
