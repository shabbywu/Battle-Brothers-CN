As the anatomists hold it up, a shout shoots in from the treeline. You turn to see a young boy there crying and pointing. Before you can grab him, he turns and runs off shouting rather descriptive prose about your ill-designed venture. In return come the murmurs of the mob, and their words are lost in a frenzy, but you can still make out the name of the %companyname% and the racket a bevy of pitchforks make when they're clattering together. You turn to tell the anatomists to quit the digging only to see they're already halfway out of the graveyard and running for their lives.
