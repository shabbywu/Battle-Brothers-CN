    "translation": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_33.png[/img]你走进陵墓，疑神疑鬼的，就好像背后的门随时会自己关上，把你们永远关在里面。 棺椁被放置在一大块大理石地面上，四角摆着明亮的烛台。 空气中一丝风也没有，但你却隐约听见忽明忽灭的风声环绕着这间斗室。 摇摇头把恐惧驱散，你和 %graverobber% 推开棺材板，小心地不让它摔到地上，那样发出的巨响恐怕会惊醒大半个镇子。\n\n 在棺材里你看见一具穿着骑士装备的尸体：头盔，胸甲，身上盖着一面盾牌。 一把宝剑从喉咙到胯下，双手握在剑柄之上。 你看了 %graverobber% 一眼，后者耸肩。%SPEECH_ON%我猜这家伙生前是个骑士。%SPEECH_OFF%你点头。盗墓贼从头到脚瞥了一下这位骑士。%SPEECH_ON%我猜…骑士大人用不上他生前的装备了…%SPEECH_OFF%你不准备空手而归，于是同意了他的看法。 在 %graverobber% 扒下他的装备时，死掉的骑士奋力挣扎。 经过几分钟的苦战，你帮着摘下了那顶头盔。 一大束金发一下子露出来。%graverobber% 向后退了一步。%SPEECH_ON%是个女人！%SPEECH_OFF%突然，墓穴外传来说话声。 你抱起地上的东西，告诉盗墓贼赶紧跑。",
