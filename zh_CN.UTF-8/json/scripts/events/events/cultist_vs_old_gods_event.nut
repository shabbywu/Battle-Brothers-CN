    "original": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_06.png[/img] You step off to the side, letting the men hash out their differences as men with great differences do. Fists for arguments, the follower of the old gods makes his case, battering the cultist again and again. But the man with the scarred head only grins in return. His eyes are puffing up, the lids purpled and puckering over his eyesight. Yet, still, he grins, and there is bloody laughter spewing out of his reddened mouth.%SPEECH_ON%Such darkness! Davkul is most pleased!%SPEECH_OFF%With an anxious look, %oldgods% steps off %cultist% and backs away. He's rubbing his bloodied knuckles, realizing he may have broken a few in the seemingly one-sided scuffle. But it's the cultist's words that hurt him most of all.%SPEECH_ON%Man isn't tempted by the darkness, he is called to it! Lost without it! Gleeful in its return!%SPEECH_OFF%Almost afraid to look back, %oldgods% hurries away as the cultist remains behind, laughing and chuckling on the grass, nobody daring to get near him.",
