When you ask what's the worry, they remind you that the cultist has a scarred forehead and speaks of incredibly strange things. Yeah. Those are the demands of Davkul, an example of one's committment. You do not understand what could possibly be wrong with that.\\n\\n You go and see the two men. %uneducated% looks up at you, smiling, and says the cultist actually has a lot to teach him. Perhaps he does, but you know Davkul's presence need not be felt in all, and if it desired being forced upon the world it would be a misapprehension of Davkul's purpose.",
