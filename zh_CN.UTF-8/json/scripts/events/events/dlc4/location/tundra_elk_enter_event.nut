    "original": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_142.png[/img]{Within the barren tundra, you find a prime hunting ground around a small lake, and so you decide to go on a short one-day kill.\n\nYou quickly spot a sizeable elk cropping the scant tundra grass. Just as you ready a kill shot, the elk's neck seizes with its snout pointed straight out. The bones crack and its limbs go bow legged as they are gripped by instant death, but it does not fall. The withers tremble and then bulb and shift as though fists rolled beneath its fur. Suddenly, the flesh tears asunder and you can see a slick blue mass bubbling between the wounds. Its legs burst apart and the torso rises high into the air as long stalks of thick bone clap to the ground and wormy, snakelike straps of muscle wrap about the shafts. You believed the elk dead, but its maw groans wildly just as its face rips apart from crown to jaw like a blossoming flower. The face of something else entirely emerges, and it pushes forward as though generated by the very gore it was busy reaping. As the new monster finds its strength, it seizes up on both hind legs and reaches his hands back to tear away the fur of the elk like a man would a cloak. Blood and bones splatter.\n\n A hideous beast three times the height of any man turns and feels out its limbs, tensing its hands, cracking its knees and shoulders, turning its head from side to side with its fat nostrils flaring like a bull. The eye sockets are all bone and a blue haze pulses within them like crackling storms. The elk's beautiful antlers have been abrogated by horrible horns. A frosty air curls from its mouth and you can see the leaves of a nearby tree go cold and brittle. \n\n You have the uneasy feeling that this monster is not in fact a monster at all, but a transient spirit which manifests itself as it sees fit, carving itself into the world as an aspect of chaos and little else. Just as you think this, the beast turns its head toward you and it hooks its long nails into the corners of its fanged mouth and stretches the lips so far out the corners could be its ears.%SPEECH_ON%Ahhh, this is the place to be, this is the place where I am happy. Why do you look with such fear, am I not but a simple deer?%SPEECH_OFF%Its head cocks to a side with the drool slopping over its bottom lip and playful tears fill its eyes. You've heard stories of this creature, a cruel horror the northerners call the Ijirok or the Beast of Winter. You know it is not here to speak poetry and play games. You draw your sword, but then a hand claps your shoulder.%SPEECH_ON%Here with you always, captain.%SPEECH_OFF%You turn to see the company at your side and ready to fight.}",
    "translation": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_142.png[/img]{在贫瘠的苔原里，你在一个小湖的周围找到了一个主要的狩猎场，所以你决定进行一次为期一天的短期捕杀。\n\n你很快就发现一只相当大的麋鹿正在啃吃稀少的苔原草。 就在你准备射杀的时候，麋鹿的脖子被抓住了，它的鼻子直接伸了出来。 它的骨头断裂，四肢弯曲，因为它们被瞬间的死亡抓住，但它没有倒下。 它的肩胛骨颤抖着，然后鳞茎移动，好像有拳头在它的皮毛下滚动。 突然，肉撕裂了，你可以看到一个光滑的蓝色肿块在伤口之间冒泡。 它的腿突然分开，躯干高高地升到空中，长长的粗骨拍击地面，像蛇一样的肌肉带缠绕在躯干上。 你相信麋鹿已经死了，但它的嘴却疯狂地呻吟着，就在它的脸从头顶到下颚像花朵一样裂开的时候。 另一个东西的脸完全显露出来，它向前推进，好像是由它正忙着收割的血迹所产生的。 当这个新怪物找到它的力量时，它用两条后腿抓住它，然后用它的手把麋鹿的皮毛撕下来，就像人撕下斗篷一样。 血和骨头飞溅。\n\n 一个比任何人高三倍高的丑陋的野兽转过身来，摸着它的四肢，拉紧它的手，扭开它的膝盖和肩膀，把它的头从一边转到另一边，肥厚的鼻孔像公牛一样张着。 眼窝都是骨头，蓝色的薄雾在眼窝里跳动，像是噼啪作响的暴风雨。 麋鹿美丽的鹿角被可怕的犄角给磨掉了。 一股冷风从它的嘴里卷起，你可以看到附近一棵树的叶子变得又冷又脆。 \n\n 你有一种不安的感觉，那就是这个怪物实际上根本不是一个怪物，而是一种短暂的灵魂，它以自己认为合适的方式显现出来，把自己作为混乱的一面雕刻在这个世界上，而不是别的什么。 正如你所想的，野兽把头转向你，把长长的指甲钩在尖牙的嘴角上，把嘴唇伸得很长，嘴角就是耳朵。%SPEECH_ON%啊，这就是我要去的地方，这就是我快乐的地方。 你为什么这么害怕，我不是一只普通的鹿吗？%SPEECH_OFF%它的头歪向一边，口水溢在下唇上，眼睛里满是顽皮的泪水。 你听说过这种生物的故事，北方人把它叫做伊吉罗克或冬天的野兽。 你知道它不是来这里说诗和玩游戏的。 你拔出剑来，却有一只手拍着你的肩膀。%SPEECH_ON%永远和你在一起，队长。%SPEECH_OFF%你转身看到战团在你身边准备战斗。}",
