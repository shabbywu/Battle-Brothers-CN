But a century ago a collective of warriors was formed to defeat a horde of undead. Ohh ya, see it in yer eyes that ye didn't know that one. It is likely that if they were defeated the walking corpses would have flooded south and killed you all. You're welcome. Bet they don't teach that in your fancy southern scripts.%SPEECH_OFF% | The man snorts and nods at the fishing pole.%SPEECH_ON%They say there's large fish down under there. Harmless ones, but big enough to spur the imagination. I can't say I've seen them in the flesh, but there was a time when a large shadow passed beneath my feet, passed right there through the waters, and it passed and passed, felt like forever. And then it was gone.%SPEECH_OFF%You ask how he thinks it a harmless beast. He shrugs.%SPEECH_ON%Cause it didn't do nothing but go from there to there and onward still.%SPEECH_OFF% | The man tests a fishing pole then crouches on his haunches. He nods across the ice.%SPEECH_ON%Ol' white bears will cross these stretches. Gotta keep your mind out for 'em. A bit of fire will fend them off, that or you dump your fish and make a run for it. I'd known a man who got eaten by a white bear. They said it ate him from legs up, giving no shits about his screaming and hollering. I'd sooner slit my own throat than let one of them beasts get a hold of me.%SPEECH_OFF% | A friendly enough fellow, the man rests beside his fishing poles and speaks to the nature of his own people.%SPEECH_ON%I'd been close enough south to know you think us savages. That's quite alright, but there's more to it than that, or less I suppose. We got less. Far less. And make do with it anyhow.%SPEECH_OFF%You remark that northerners frequent the south only to rape and pillage what it has. The man shrugs.%SPEECH_ON%And you send war parties north to treat us to a sense of southern justice. Seems fair enough. Nobody's doing nothing that don't have a bit of retribution hanging there clear as day to see. We're all on level.%SPEECH_OFF% | As you set beside the man he catches a fish and yanks it onto the ice. He grasps it with a fur-gloved hand and smashes its head to stop its flopping. He talks as he guts and salts it.%SPEECH_ON%Some of the northerners figured out a way to tame them giants, the unholds I think you call them.  Don't ask me how. Anytime I'd heard of a giant going anywhere all it did was kill anyone in its path and eat all the livestock.%SPEECH_OFF% | The man snorts and tests his fishing rods and sighs when there's no pull.%SPEECH_ON%I went south a few years back. Stayed there a few years just as well. That's how I know your tongue so well. When I was down that way, I tasted what you call vegetables. Disgusting things, truly, and the south wonders how we grow so big and strong up there in these wastes? I'll tell ya, we can't grow no fucking vegetables. Only thing we eat has to die and nothing with a heartbeat is willing to die easy.%SPEECH_OFF% | The friendly northern fisherman tells you stories of how the tribes come and go.%SPEECH_ON%I'll say this much, we're only run by the strong, but a strong man is only as good as his health and constitution. When he gets old, he loses both. When he gets old, he therefore loses. And so the new strong man comes to power, and with it a shattering of the tribe's history and successes. I do in part envy the southerner's sense of greater purpose, and the southerner's ability to hide his power, to stock it at arm's length so that others must do more than just swing a sword to get it from him. I tell you this in truth, and only here, as far away from my countrymen as I can be. You'll never hear me say any of this around no ordinary campfire, understand?%SPEECH_OFF%}",
    "translation": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_26.png[/img]{你问他北方是否经历过毁灭性战争。他耸耸肩。%SPEECH_ON%嗯，我们之间有分歧。 又是这样又是那样。 但一个世纪以前，由勇士组织起来的一支战团打败了一群亡灵。 噢呀，你的眼神告诉了我你的无知。 如果他们被打败了，很有可能那些亡灵就会涌向南方杀光你们。 不用客气。我敢打赌僵尸不是去教你读南方花哨故事的。%SPEECH_OFF% | 这人对着钓竿哼了一声点头。%SPEECH_ON%别人说这下面有一条大鱼。 没攻击性，但是大的超乎想象。 我不敢说我亲眼见过，但是有一次，一个巨大的影子从我脚下穿过，就在那边，它游来游去，感觉时间停止了。 然后它就消失了。%SPEECH_OFF%你问他是怎么知道它没攻击性呢。他耸耸肩。%SPEECH_ON%因为它什么也没做，只是从这到那然后继续游。%SPEECH_OFF% | 这个人试了试钓竿，接着他蹲下来。 他在冰上点头示意。%SPEECH_ON%白熊会穿过那些地方。 你要小心点。 一点火星子就能把熊挡开，不然你就把鱼扔掉，撒腿开溜。 我认识一个被白熊吃掉的人。 听说熊从他的腿开始吃，对他的抓喊尖叫毫不在乎。 我宁愿割破自己的喉咙，也不愿让那些畜生抓住我。%SPEECH_OFF% | 这个人很友好，坐在钓竿旁很放松地跟大家伙说话聊天。%SPEECH_ON%我离南方很近，知道你们觉得我们是野蛮人。 这很好，但很重要的一点是，我们的资源很少。 非常少。少的可怜。 不管怎样都要凑合活下去。%SPEECH_OFF%你说北方人频繁来南方只是为了抢劫。那人耸耸肩。%SPEECH_ON%你们把战争送到北方，让我们感受来自南方的正义。 看起来不错。没人可以为所欲为而不受惩罚。 万物守恒。%SPEECH_OFF% | 当你坐在这家伙旁边时，他抓住一条鱼并把它拉上来。 他用带着皮手套的手抓住它，然后猛击鱼的头，直到鱼停止扑腾。 他边说边把鱼的内脏掏掉然后撒上盐。%SPEECH_ON%一些北方人想出一个办法来驯服这些巨人，我想你们称呼他们为释放者。  别问我怎么做的。 每当我听到一个巨人去什么地方，它所做的就只是杀掉或吃掉路上的任何牲畜。%SPEECH_OFF% | 这个人哼了一声，看了看他的钓竿，没有鱼上钩他又叹了口气。%SPEECH_ON%我几年前去过南方。 我也在那待了几年。 这就是我了解你口味的原因。 我在那的时候尝了你们称之为蔬菜的东西。 真够恶心的，你们想知道我们是怎么长得这么壮的？ 我告诉你，我们不能种那该死的蔬菜。 我们只有把活着的东西杀死吃掉，才能让我们的心脏强壮地成长。%SPEECH_OFF% | 友好的北方渔民给你讲述了部落的三三两两。%SPEECH_ON%我想说的是，我们只由强者统治，但强者的健康和体质决定了一切。 当他老了，他就失去了一切。 当他老了，他就输了。 于是，新的强者掌权，部落的成功与历史随之改写。 我的确有点羡慕南方人有更大的使命感，也羡慕你们有能力隐藏自己的权力，使自己与他人保持一定距离，这样其他人除了挥剑还需要做的更多才能夺走他的权力。 说句实话，就在这，离我的同胞越远越好。 一般情况下我绝不会说这些，你明白吗？%SPEECH_OFF%}",
