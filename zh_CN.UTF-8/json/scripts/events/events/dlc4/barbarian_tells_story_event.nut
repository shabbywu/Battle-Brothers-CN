    "original": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_26.png[/img]{%barbarian% shares tales around the campfire of northern heroics and monsters. There can't be much said of his dialogue, given that he isn't the most eloquent, but he does a great job of it through miming and drawing in the ground. {One tale seems to be that of a huge warrior defeating a much larger warrior, or perhaps even defeating an ogre. It's hard to tell, but the barbarian makes a fascinating display of combat which the men applaud. | One tale is of two lovers, and with great use of his hands, makes a riveting show of what it is to plough and be ploughed. And, apparently, what it is to be betrayed and stabbed in the back. You're not sure who is stabbing whom, nor when or in what sense, but the tale has the men on the edges of their seats and ends with applause. | One tale speaks to a friendly unhold. The men gasp at the very notion of it, but the barbarian slaps his wrists and wags his finger. This, you assume, is his way of telling you it's all true, every word or grunt. The idea of a friendly monster unsettles the men initially, but by the end of the story they clap and nod as though they wish it really were the truth.}",
