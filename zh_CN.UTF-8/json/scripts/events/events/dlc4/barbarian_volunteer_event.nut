You never know what monstrous man or beastly barbarian you'll come across next. This time it is a large man limping with a dog beside him.

He explains that his clan had a dispute, and that he was to duel another man to decide who would take control. You ask why he did not duel this man, you ask if he is afraid. The traveler shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%No. The clansman was my brother. And I'd no desire to kill kin. They gave me this bitch here as both insult and reward and threw me from the tribe. I've no land or people to go to, but if you'd have me, I'd surely fight for you just as well as anyone else.%SPEECH_OFF%}",
