With a couple of scouts you go out to see what it is, suspecting little more than perhaps an animal carcass or abandoned camp. Instead, you find a party of naked corpses with their bodies crouched as though they were sitting upon chairs. They're in a close-knit circle, all facing inward, some with their hands out as if warming them at a fire. You push one of the corpses. As it tips back, the body sitting opposite raises up. %randombrother% jumps away.%SPEECH_ON%By the old gods!%SPEECH_OFF%A rim of flesh runs just beneath the powdered snow, and the ring connects one corpse to the other, a shared desecration beyond your understanding. The skin runs inward, meeting at a fleshen fulcrum which rises out of the snow shaped like some macabre flower pot. Nothing is inside. One of the scouts demands a return to the safety of the company and you very much agree with him.}",
