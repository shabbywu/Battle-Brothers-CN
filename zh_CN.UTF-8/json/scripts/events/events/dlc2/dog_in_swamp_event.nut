He wades into the mire like some ale strewn saint departing a crowd before they recognize his face. Such is his struggle that he topples over on top of the dog and disappears into the froth and bubbles of the battle. You rush to his side and pull him ashore, the man covered in moss and his boots wrapped in lily pads and he's hacking nasty swamp water and picking out the brine which fermented it. There's no sight of the dog, just a slight ripple of water which trails away from the scene. Unnerved, its owner nods.%SPEECH_ON%Appreciate the effort, but it is what it is. The swamp sees to such things because it's a swamp and fark this goddam farkin' place I'd see this whole shitstain of geographical oddity drained and burned and salted to nothing but a wasteland whole if I could!%SPEECH_OFF%You raise an eyebrow and ask if he lives in the swamp.
