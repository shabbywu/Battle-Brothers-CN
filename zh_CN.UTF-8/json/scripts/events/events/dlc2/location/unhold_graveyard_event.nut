The heaviest of the bones stay where their owner's breath had last ushered them, while the smallest of the sort have long since rolled to the valley ditch and settled there in a wash of white wimpled with whatever flesh and fur remains.\n\nYou've no reason to believe that none other than the unholds themselves plotted their demise here. Violence is not in their shapes. They are sitting up or laying down in peaceful eternities, and indeed %randombrother% points out a great giant which seems to have recently laid itself to rest. It is nestled into an earthen nook with its hands wrapped over its knees and its head tilted on a shoulder. It watched the sunset, and will do so for many years to come. Not that you care. You order the men to fan out and collect what they can. Some of these bones or pelts or what else they've brought could be of great use to the company.}",
