    "original": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_101.png[/img]{Halfway into the quarry and rounding a long bend, you notice a series of hallways cut into the lower wall. You cast up a fist. The company seizes, bumbling into one another as the formation comes to a stop. %randombrother% asks what's wrong. You put a finger to your lips. \\n\\n With the lightest of steps you approach one of the ropes strung between this level and the very bottom of the pit. A pail filled with soil totters the tether as though jittered by your appearance. The pulley used to draw it up and down has long since rusted over. You draw your sword and cut the rope. The binding shoots back like a whip and the bucket plummets. It clatters side to side off the rocks until striking the ground with a metal pang and a cloud of dust. And just like that, the silence is gone.\\n\\n Pale men flood out of the hallways below, a stream of malignant miners and ditch diggers in haggard drawers and boots and capes of shredded shirts, shambling back out as though returning to some long gone work left incomplete. You try and count their numbers but are mightily distracted when a throng of armored soldiers march out behind the mob, this outfit carrying polearms, shields, spears and, most dangerously of all, a sense of cohesion.\\n\\n No point in running out of the quarry. Nothing in the land to run to. When you look back at the men, they're already drawing out their weapons. %randombrother% nods.%SPEECH_ON%With you to the end, captain.%SPEECH_OFF%}",

    "original": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_101.png[/img]{From a distance, the Black Monolith looked like a black tower tilting from the earth. The sky above was without blemish, as though the clouds and the birds were circumventing some unseen mountain. A numbness settled its hinterland, terra neither dying nor growing, and a cruel silence left the listless life worse than no life at all. Adventurers went to it and did not return. Stories of their demise stacked high until their absence shielded the monolith whole, clothing it in such fear and menace no one dared go near.\\n\\n But now the %companyname% stands before the obelisk like ants at the steel of a staked sword. Here you see that the structure was not built upon the earth at all: the obelisk rests in the pit of an abandoned quarry. Roads and paths sidewinder into the depths like some great and hollow terra socket. Ropes carrying buckets hang across every gap, innumerable pails of dirt left listing like fireless lanterns on a festive night. More bindings hold the frames of bridges, the walkway planks long since fallen, and more yet wrap about the monolith as though a great bevy of men had attempted to pull it down or perhaps even correct its tilt. At the bottom of this abandoned pit is the base of the monolith, but to you this is only a guess. It has every appearance of never stopping its descent into the very earth and whatever is below. Shovels and pickaxes litter about its obsidian walls with soil still clumped on their metals. %randombrother% nods at the scene.%SPEECH_ON%Looks like whoever was digging there got interrupted.%SPEECH_OFF%The man's words carry far into the quarry and there become so presently shaped in echo that you just about watch them go. Looking back, you see that the silence itself has followed you in, but even here at the edge of the pit it is pensive and cut with ease. The decision to enter the quarry rests heavy on your shoulders.}",
    "translation": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_101.png[/img]{从远处看去，黑色的方尖碑就像一座从地面倾斜的黑色塔楼。上空的天空毫无瑕疵，就像云和鸟儿绕过了某座看不见的山。一种麻木已经落在了这片腹地上，大地既不衰弱也不生长，一片残酷的沉寂使得这里无生命之苦更加难以忍受。冒险家们去过那里，但没有一个人回来。他们死亡的传说一直在堆积，一直到他们的缺席把整个方尖碑笼罩起来，给它裹上了一层可怕的恐惧和威胁，没有人敢靠近。\\n\\n但现在，%companyname%就像钢剑上的蚂蚁一样来到方尖碑的前面。在这里，你会发现这个建筑物根本就没有建在地上：方尖碑休息在一个废弃采石场的坑里。道路和小径像一些巨大的中空地下孔眼一样蜿蜒向深处。满是泥土的无数桶悬挂在每个间隙上，像节日之夜上的无火灯笼。更多的绳索固定着桥梁的框架，曾经的人行道板早已垮塌。还有更多的丝带像一大群人一样缠绕在方尖碑周围，似乎是要推倒它，或者纠正它的倾斜。在这个废弃坑洞的底部是方尖碑的基座，但对你来说这只是一个猜测。它看起来好像永远都在向地下和下面的未知世界降下。铲子和鹤嘴锄散落在它的黑曜石墙上，金属上仍然沾着土壤。%randombrother%对这个场景点点头。%SPEECH_ON%看起来挖掘的人被打断了。%SPEECH_OFF%这个人的话传到了采石场之外，变得如此清晰，以至于你都可以看到它们。回头看，你会发现沉默本身已经跟随着你，但即使在坑边，它也很沉思而不紧张。进入采石场的决定让你的心情沉重。}",
