    "original": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_105.png[/img]{The creature was almost too large to die properly on its side and instead tilts forward with its horrid mouth gaping like a hole blasted into a leaning bastion. One sellsword sits crosslegged atop the kraken's dome like a monk deep in study.

You ask the mercenaries what of import has been found and one waves you over to the creature's maw.
