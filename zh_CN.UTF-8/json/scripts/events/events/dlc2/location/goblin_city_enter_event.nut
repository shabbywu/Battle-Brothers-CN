There are far too many to take on and with the numbers already on their side it is even likely the families of the goblins will partake in your slaughter, and you will have only enshrined the city whole with further experience in slaughtering humans. So you wait. And think. And then the man approaches.\n\n He's bound in light armor with a leafy hood used to camouflage the metal beneath and a multitude of swords clank from his hip and a spear yokes across his back one way and an axe the other and bandolier of potions chime as he comes to a halt. You can't see his face, much less his eyes, and he's dripping with the blood of recent action.%SPEECH_ON%Despite their cruelties and cruel appearance, the goblins are in a way a civilized group. They will respond to violence that is at its base nothing more than senseless savagery. If you wish to draw them out, then you must do as the orcs do. My plan was to slaughter as many as I could find in the fields, raiding parties, scouts, the like, but it is just as well that their encampments are destroyed in great number. Together, the carnage will be a pincer upon their fears, for they fear reckless orcs more than anything and will seek to preemptively snuff them out.%SPEECH_OFF%The man nods as though you've already agreed to something.%SPEECH_ON%So choose, traveler, the manner in which you wish to have this city laid flat.

Saying the goblins built their city around the mountains is like saying a soldier sheathed his sword in his enemy's chest. The gibbering greenskins didn't add to the terrain, they desecrated the place whole, putting mines where trees used to be, constructing a maze of rusted shanties and lean-tos, raising cultish totems and digging primitive sacrificial pits, piling unused timber as though the mutilation of the mountain was not truly finished without blatant waste.\n\n But beyond the goblin rubbish does stand a central core of the city, a number of towers unambiguously set apart from the riffraff. These are clearly ancient requisitions, the stonework being unlike anything you've ever seen and surely beyond the greenskin's scope of construct. The goblins walking amongst the walls are upright and boastful as though invigorated by being allowed to stride such hallowed grounds. Nestled inside the fortress seem to be of some sort of higher nobility, well dressed goblins with servants mucking about, which means the same thing it does when it comes to humans: there's good loot to be had.\n\n A rare sight are the little ones running about. Families, if that's what the greenskins truly have, will mean that a fight here will be a vicious one. The little maggots will have more to protect than just their savageness and greed, and that which must extend itself beyond its own vices is also that which has been weakened.}",
