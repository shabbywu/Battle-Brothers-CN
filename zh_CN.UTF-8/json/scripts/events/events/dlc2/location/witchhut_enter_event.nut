She suggests it is only rabbit and potatoes, and more the former than the latter. Sheathing your sword, you take the bowl and have a seat at a table with her opposite you. A couple of candles burn nearby, and there are glyphs painted on the walls in white, and similar shapes hang from the ceiling as dreamcatchers. The woman puts her elbows on the table. There are trinkets wound into her hair, clips of bird bones and feathers. She carries a weathered face, though her eyes are starkly young like pearls glimmering from the depths of a swamp.%SPEECH_ON%I knew you would come in, a phantom of a friend, like a moth to the flame, seeking truth which cannot be tamed.%SPEECH_OFF%Pushing the bowl back across the table, you ask if she is a witch. She nods affirmatively and stares at you before nodding again.%SPEECH_ON%Good. You haven't killed me which means you're thinking now. I am indeed a so-called witch, but I am alone. Entirely alone. And hounded by the others. You might call them my 'sisters', but these others know who you are, just as I do, and they want your blood. They can smell it and that is why I want to talk.%SPEECH_OFF%}",
