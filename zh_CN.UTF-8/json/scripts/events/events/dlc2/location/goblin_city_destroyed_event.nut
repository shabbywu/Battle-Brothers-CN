    "original": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_119.png[/img]{The goblin vanguard vanquished, you march on the city to ransack it. Tiny goblins are slain and scalped or beheaded. More yet scurry around you like ants, each carrying something above their heads like human skulls or treasures and one sprints madly about toting a flagpole with its banner aflame and another dances with the decapitated head of a wolf. Your men turn over huts and shanties and kick out leaners and anything found breathing is put to an end.\n\n An ancient fortress the goblins used for a city core is set upon with a pillager's eye. You enter the halls yourself and there find a blind goblin crawling with a wreath of human femurs hanging from its neck. The greenskin chitters and chamfers in your general direction, no doubt sensing your presence, though a pained grimace on its face means it also senses the annihilation of its people. You gut the greenskin and leave it to die on the stone floor. Your mercenaries run on ahead and into a council room full of elders and cut them all down in a murderous frenzy that has limbs flying and fingers scattering and blood shooting up the walls and across the tables.\n\n You head outside to the castle yard. Here you find a pile of dead humans, some mutilated, others charged, one stuffed with a torch as though his ribcage were a brazier. Past the corpses you spot the wolfrider kennels. You have wolf cages burned and their trainers thrown in the fires to die with them. One of the wolves breaks free and sprints further into the city with a cape of flame for fur. It runs from abode to abode barking and howling for relief. You watch as the flames rapidly burn thatched huts and strawroofed shacks. Before you yourself are consumed in the fiery carnage, you order the men back out and watch the whole place burn to the ground. With the savages taken care of, you take inventory of the loot.}",

We did good.%SPEECH_OFF%You ask him if he set the fire. He nods.%SPEECH_ON%Goblins stagger their rearguard in mazes of walls and mines. I shuttered their escapes to hem the population between two walls, closed the way out, closed the way in, and set fire to everything. They perished quickly. I see you fared well.
