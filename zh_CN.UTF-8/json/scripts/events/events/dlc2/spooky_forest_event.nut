He plants a foot on the trunk to wrench the tool free and that's about the last you see of him as he goes flying away. A tree branch swings back into view with a long groan emanating from the trunk as though some ancient wood were being felled inside its very body.

You'd think they spotted a fair maiden up in those parts the way he's going. It isn't long until he's gone, though the scratch 'n' scratch of his noisy ascent is unmistakable. Finally you hear him returning, the clutter of his descent coming in stops and starts as he finds safe footing. You see him break back into view, the soles of his boots first to appear like butter trays dangling in the dark. His shadowy silhouette follows, sliding ever downward until he makes a last leap to the earth. He intentionally buckles at the knees and rolls back against the tree trunk with his tired hands limp across his knees.%SPEECH_ON%T'was a black bear head deep in a honeycomb, but the beast been dead at least two days.
