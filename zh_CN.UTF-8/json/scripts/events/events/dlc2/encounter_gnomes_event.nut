    "translation": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_25.png[/img]你放松了一下手中的武器，决定亲自前去侦查前方的树林。出发没过五分钟，你就听到了一个稳定的嗡嗡声，似乎是在唱歌。你拔出剑，翻过一座倒下的树木堆看向下方。你看到了一个由一打看起来像是小人的人围成的圆舞曲。有一半吹着低沉的口哨，而另一半则一遍遍地重复着你从未听过的某个词语。在这无聊的表演的中央，有一棵蘑菇和一只看起来很无聊的蟾蜍。在偶尔的情况下，有一个小人会跑上去碰一下蘑菇或者蟾蜍，然后在回到圆舞曲时露出偷窃的表情。\n\n这太过诡异。你向前爬去，想要更仔细地看一看，却没想到碰到一根枝条，发出砰的一声巨响。小人们立刻停止唱歌，像一群猎物一样看向你。其中一个用含糊不清的语言喊叫着，然后所有人都跳着蹦着逃开了，躲进了树洞或灌木丛中。当你到达地面寻找他们时，你却什么都没找到。他们已经完全消失了。你走到树桩旁，发现蟾蜍被一把匕首刺到了最后，而蘑菇已经消失不见了。",
