    "original": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_25.png[/img]You give the men a break and decide to scout the forest ahead yourself. Not more than five minutes out you hear the steady hum of chanting. Drawing your sword, you crest an embarkment of fallen trees and look over the side. There you see a dozen of what look like miniature men dancing in a circle. Half or whistling lowly while the rest keep repeating some word you've never heard before. In the center of the nonsense is a mushroom and a very bored looking toad which, occasionally, one mini man will run up and touch before sprinting back to the circle grinning as though he got away with some roguish crime.\n\n This is too much. You crawl forward to get a better look only to have a branch snap under your weight. The little men stop instantly and look toward you like a herd of prey. One yells in gibberish and the lot of them skip and hop away, diving into tree holes or into bushes. When you go down to see them out, you find nothing. They've vanished entirely. You go to the stump and find the toad impaled to the hilt by a dagger and the mushroom gone.",
    "translation": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_25.png[/img]你放松了一下手中的武器，决定亲自前去侦查前方的树林。出发没过五分钟，你就听到了一个稳定的嗡嗡声，似乎是在唱歌。你拔出剑，翻过一座倒下的树木堆看向下方。你看到了一个由一打看起来像是小人的人围成的圆舞曲。有一半吹着低沉的口哨，而另一半则一遍遍地重复着你从未听过的某个词语。在这无聊的表演的中央，有一棵蘑菇和一只看起来很无聊的蟾蜍。在偶尔的情况下，有一个小人会跑上去碰一下蘑菇或者蟾蜍，然后在回到圆舞曲时露出偷窃的表情。\n\n这太过诡异。你向前爬去，想要更仔细地看一看，却没想到碰到一根枝条，发出砰的一声巨响。小人们立刻停止唱歌，像一群猎物一样看向你。其中一个用含糊不清的语言喊叫着，然后所有人都跳着蹦着逃开了，躲进了树洞或灌木丛中。当你到达地面寻找他们时，你却什么都没找到。他们已经完全消失了。你走到树桩旁，发现蟾蜍被一把匕首刺到了最后，而蘑菇已经消失不见了。",
