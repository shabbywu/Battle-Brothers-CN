He's got a walking stick with its end shaved to a ball to navigate muddy roads. When you get near, he straightens up and tents his hands on the top of the staff.%SPEECH_ON%Oy', mercenaries are ye? I'd avoid the forests if I were ye. They say trees roam those parts now. They don't do so in menace, but neither does a motha' bear when it chows down on your balls for getting too close. It's a matter of nature, ye know?%SPEECH_OFF%Uh, sure. | A man is found beside the road reading some tomes. He looks up, turning one of the pages for you to see, displaying a drawing of a tree with long branches extended to the ground. The trunk is lit with eyes.%SPEECH_ON%They call 'em schrats. Trees that will claw and kill anything that gets close, but I don't think that's quite right. I don't think they're animals, I think they're calculating and smart monsters with a vengeful attitude toward matters of trespass. So don't trespass upon them, understand? Stay out of the forests.%SPEECH_OFF%Not in the mood for idle tree talk, you wish the man well in his studies and quickly move on. | An elderly woman carrying a basket crosses paths with your company. She gestures toward the goods, a pile of chopped firewood.%SPEECH_ON%If ye want some fyewood, aye, best stay clear of where I got it.%SPEECH_OFF%You ask what she means. She grins all wily like.%SPEECH_ON%A schrat in the forest watched me do it, gave me propuh permission to warm meself with this here tinder. Didn't give my uncle permission.

    "translation": "%terrainImage%{你在路上遇到了一个年轻的旅行者。他的草帽里外颠倒，好像是为了接雨水。他手里拿着一根行走在泥泞的路上的手杖，杖头被削成了球形。当你走近时，他挺直身子，手抱在手杖顶端。%SPEECH_ON%哦，你们是雇佣兵吧？要是我就避开森林。他们说树现在在那些地方漫游着。它们没有恶意，但妈妈熊在吃掉你的蛋蛋之前也不会有敌意。这是自然规律，你懂的吗？%SPEECH_OFF% 哦，好的。 | 在路边，有个人正在阅读一些书卷。他抬头，翻动了其中的一页，展示出一幅树的图画，有着长长的枝叶延伸到地面，树干上还有着眼睛和光芒。%SPEECH_ON%他们叫它们Schrats。树会抓住并杀死任何靠近的东西，但我觉得那不太正确。它们不是动物，我认为它们是具有报复心态的精明的、聪明的怪物。所以不要去闯入它们的领域，明白吗？远离森林。%SPEECH_OFF%你当然不想闲扯，祝福那个人的研究，并迅速离开了。 | 一个扛着篮子的老妇人和你的队伍穿过了路口。她朝着货物做了个手势，那是一堆劈好的柴火。%SPEECH_ON%如果你想要一些柴火，最好不要去我取它的地方。%SPEECH_OFF%你问她是什么意思。她狡黠地笑了笑。%SPEECH_ON%森林里有一个Schrats在看着我，给了我合适的许可证让我用这里的柴火取暖。它并没有给我叔叔许可。它撕开了我叔叔的身体然后挂起了他的肉。也许是装饰作用，你懂的吗？%SPEECH_OFF% 噢，当然。}",
