He says he'll do his best to manage. You nod and thank him for his honesty. The news worries you, but there is little recourse as of yet. | The men explain that %addict% has strongly taken to the potions and vials and flasks, the ones that carry spirits beyond just good ale and mead. You're not sure if it's from overuse or because he is having difficulty handling the struggles of being a sellsword. A few of the men are told to keep an eye on him. It's the best you can do for now.}",
