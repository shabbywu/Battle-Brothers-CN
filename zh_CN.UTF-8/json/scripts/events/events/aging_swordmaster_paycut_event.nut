    "original": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_17.png[/img]%swordmaster% enters your tent. You wave him to the chair across your table. He sits so slowly and feebly that you fear him standing back up will take twice as long. The man clasps his hands together and elbows his arms onto the table, grunting and shifting, finding little comfort even in doing nothing at all. His lips are dry, his face withered. Liver spots mottle his head and even the hairs about his nose and ears are grey.\\n\\n You always have time for %swordmaster% so you ask what it is he wishes to speak about.%SPEECH_ON%This might sound peculiar coming from a blade for hire, but I think it needs saying anyway, and it'd make me sleep better at night. I'll be forward with you: I am not the man you hired so long ago. You know that. I know that. Some of the men know it, but they're respectful as good men are.%SPEECH_OFF%You agree, but don't nod. Instead, you ask what the man is getting at.%SPEECH_ON%I wish to lower my wage. Now don't be saying no, you don't have to bullshit me. I'll take a cut. Money's never been an issue anyhow. Those crowns could be used to help arm the men or even pay them better. God knows a young man could always use an extra crown or two.%SPEECH_OFF%Before you say another word, the man springs to his feet with surprising speed. He nods and grins playfully before yelling loudly.%SPEECH_ON%I agree with your decision, good sir. I could use a paycut!%SPEECH_OFF%You laugh as the man leaves your tent almost as soon as he'd come in.",
    "translation": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_17.png[/img]%swordmaster% 进入你的帐篷。 你挥手让他坐到你桌子对面的椅子上。 他坐得很慢，很虚弱，你担心他站起来要花两倍的时间。 他双手合十，胳膊肘搭在桌子上，嘴里嘟囔着，不停地挪动着身子，似乎无法找到慰藉，让你无所适从。 他的嘴唇是干的，他的脸皮是皱的。 他的头上有斑痕，甚至鼻子和耳朵周围的头发都是灰色的。\\n\\n 你经常有时间和 %swordmaster% 交流，所以你问他想说什么。%SPEECH_ON%这可能听起来很奇怪，但我认为无论如何这都是需要说的，它会让我晚上睡得更好。 我很坦率地告诉你：我已经不是你很久以前雇用的那个人了。 你知道的。我知道。 有些队员也知道这一点，但他们像好人一样尊重人。%SPEECH_OFF%你同意，但不要点头。 相反，你应该问这个男人到底想说什么。%SPEECH_ON%我希望降低我的工资。 现在不要拒绝，你没必要骗我。 我要打个对折。 钱从来都不是问题。 这些克朗可以用来帮助武装这些人，甚至可以给他们更好的报酬。 神明们知道，年轻人总是需要多用一两克朗。%SPEECH_OFF%你还没来得及说一个字，那人就以惊人的速度跳了起来。 他点了点头，开心地笑了笑，然后大声嚷嚷起来。%SPEECH_ON%我同意你的决定，好心的先生。 我需要减薪！%SPEECH_OFF%你哈哈大笑，这个人离开了你的帐篷，像他进来的时候一样迅速。",
