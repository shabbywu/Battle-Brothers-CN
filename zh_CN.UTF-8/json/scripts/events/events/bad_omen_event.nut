    "original": "{[img]gfx/ui/events/event_12.png[/img]Cries whip through the party like the howls of the wind. There is not an enemy in sight so you've no idea what is causing this. You walk the ranks to find %superstitious% practically sobbing on the ground. He is clutching his chest with one hand while the other points to the sky, the finger shaking in pointed fear. %otherguy% explains that the man saw a great blaze of fire cross by the stars. Apparently this pathetic fool takes it for an omen and, of course, it isn't a good one. Whatever it is, it isn't going to get you where you need to be so you order the men to march. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_12.png[/img] Shadows begin to fold in and on themselves in strange ways. You turn around to see the sun darkening, a great rim of black moving over it. Soon there is no sun at all. %superstitious% cries out that the end times are coming, but before his wailing can find a grip on the rest of your men, the great shade unveils the sun once more and there is light again as though nothing happened at all. You tell the pathetic fool to get to his feet. You've places to march and tears sure as hell won't get you there. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_11.png[/img] %superstitious% is poking his sword into a warren when he suddenly cries out. He leaps away from the rabbit hole and screams that there is a two headed bunny within. Apparently this is a bad omen of things to come. All you can think is that two heads just means more meat for the stew. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_11.png[/img]You pass beneath a tree whose branches are occupied by both a black cat and an albino crow. %superstitious% cries at the sight of it, saying that this is surely a sign of the end times. Why yes, of course it is. These things are never a sign of good things, right? Yeesh. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_11.png[/img] You come across a deer skull. At first it means nothing to you, but %superstitious% picks it up with earnest. Muted dust pours out of the cavity as he turns it this way and that. Hands trembling, he throws the head out of his hands. It clatters hollow against the ground, tumbling over onto where the horns should be. The scared man claims that a soothsayer once told him that he would come across a skull such as this.\n\nThere are many skulls out here, you argue, because things have a tendency to die. Your words do nothing for the man as he slowly, and nervously, shuffles back into the marching rank. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_11.png[/img] Marching along, a few of the men take up a game of finding shapes in the clouds. They banter back and forth about dogs and fat women and even of home, but the fun takes a wild turn when %superstitious% sees one odd-shaped cloud that brings him to his knees. He cries out that it is a bad omen, this cloud, and that doom will soon be upon the company. Thankfully, the fear does not grip the rest of the company who, instead of trembling, soon start bickering over whether or not the cloud is truly representative of %randombrother%'s impressive endowment.}",
    "translation": "{[img]gfx/ui/events/event_12.png[/img]哭喊声像狂风的怒号一样从人群中呼啸而过。 在视野里没有一个敌人，所以你不知道是什么发出的声音。 你走在队伍里，发现 %superstitious% 几乎趴在地上哭泣。 他一只手抓着胸口，另一只手指向天空，手指因恐惧而颤抖。%otherguy% 解释说，这家伙看到了星星旁边燃起熊熊大火。 很明显，这个可怜的傻瓜把它当成了一个征兆，当然，这不是一个好兆头。 不管它是什么，它不会把你带到你需要去的地方，所以你命令队员们继续行军。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_12.png[/img] 他们的影子开始以奇怪的方式向外和向内呈现。 你转过身去，看到太阳正在变黑，一个巨大的黑环在它上面移动。 很快就没有太阳了。%superstitious% 哭着说世界末日就要到了，但是在他的号啕大哭能够传染你的其他队员之前，巨大的阴影再次遮蔽了太阳，光明又出现了，就好像什么都没有发生一样。 你叫那个可怜的傻瓜站起来。 你有行军的目的地，眼泪肯定屁用没有，不会带你到达目的地。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_11.png[/img] %superstitious% 他正在把剑刺入一个兔子洞时突然大哭起来。 他从兔子洞里旁边跳起来，尖叫着说里面有一只双头兔。 显然这是一个不好的兆头。 你所能想到的是，两个脑袋只是意味着有更多肉可以炖。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_11.png[/img]你从一棵树下经过，那棵树的树枝上既有一只黑猫，也有一只白乌鸦。%superstitious% 一看到就开始哭，说这肯定是世界末日的前兆。 为什么是，因为它就是。 这些都不是好事的征兆，对吧？是的。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_11.png[/img] 你偶遇到一个鹿的头骨。 一开始你认为它毫无意义，但是 %superstitious% 一脸认真地捡起它。 当他反复转动鹿头骨的时候，无声的灰尘从里面倾泻而出。 他双手颤抖着，把鹿头骨从手里扔出去。 它在地面上砰砰作响，应该滚到了一个有棱角的地方。 这个吓坏了的人说，曾经有一个占卜者告诉他，他会遇到这样一个头骨。\n\n这里有很多这样的头骨，你争执道，因为事物都会走向死亡。 你的话对他毫无用处，因为他慢慢地，紧张地，拖着脚步回到了行军的行列。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_11.png[/img] 在行军途中，几个人玩起了在云中寻找形状的游戏。 他们来来回回地开着狗和胖女人的玩笑，甚至开着关于家的玩笑，但是当 %superstitious% 看到一朵奇形怪状的云后跪下来的时候，乐事就发生了疯狂的转变。 他哭着说，这团乌云是个不祥之兆，厄运很快就会降临到战队头上。 值得庆幸的是，这种恐惧并没有影响到战队的其他成员，恰恰相反，他们很快开始争论这朵云是否真的代表 %randombrother%的惊人天赋。}",
