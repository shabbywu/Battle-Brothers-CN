Not wholly able to see who they are, you order a few of your brothers to hide away. An ambush might be needed to defend yourself otherwise you stand no chance against such a mounted force. As the selected mercenaries dip into the bushes, the horsemen begin heading down the hill. The thunder of the hooves grows louder, but you stand resolute, hoping to give your men a good show of bravery.\n\nYou see that the bannerman is carrying a sigil of %noblehousename%. Behind him another horseman is dragging a travois with a few shackled men for cargo. When the men arrive, their leader stands up between the withers of his horse and points at you before talking.%SPEECH_ON%Mercenary! We have by the lord's authority the right to claim the - shackled! - hands of a sir %criminal%. Said man is within your midst. He must pay for his crimes. Hand him over immediately and you will be rewarded.%SPEECH_OFF%You turn your head and spit. You nod at the lawman before asking him a question.%SPEECH_ON%And whose authority do you have? There are a lot of lords in these lands and not all of them pay me well.%SPEECH_OFF%The lawmen's captain sits back down in his saddle. His hands cross over his pommel, resting there with armored authority. He does not look the least bit amused and voices his displeasure as such.%SPEECH_ON%The punishment for willfully harboring a fugitive is death. You've but one more chance to release this criminal to me or you shall face a fate well suited for a sword-selling dog.%SPEECH_OFF%\""
