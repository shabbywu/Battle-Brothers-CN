    "translation": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_52.png[/img]{你发现雇佣兵簇拥在营火旁边，只是他们没有把能够被称作食物的东西放在火上。一人将他那碗汤倒了过来。那汤就像污泥一样粘在碗上，没有流出去的迹象，说老实话，这实在是太恶心了。%randombrother%看着你。%SPEECH_ON%先生，拜托了，让我们吃点肉吧！或者任何别的比这种狗屎强的东西！%SPEECH_OFF%有点变化也无妨，你同意。 | %randombrother%来到你身边，把勺子摔在你的桌子上。勺子上有东西，但你不确定那是什么。那佣兵靠在椅背上，双手插在腰间，胸膛随着呼吸而起伏。然后他叹了口气，因为他知道不能在你面前表现得如此无礼。但他确实为自己做了解释。%SPEECH_ON%先生，伙计们在抱怨食物。我想如果我们能在下一个城镇买些肉和其他货物，对战团的士气会很有帮助。当然，这只是一个建议。%SPEECH_OFF%他很快走开了。你拿起勺子，仔细琢磨勺子里的东西是什么。那……那不会是他们在外面吃的东西吧？也许换个口味也无妨…… | %randombrother%手里拿着碗走来。他把碗向前倾斜，露出碗里的东西，它们是无色的，慢慢地沿着碗的边缘滑落。这个佣兵摇了摇头。%SPEECH_ON%先生，弟兄们今晚都不高兴，我也不高兴，因为我们一直在吃的这东西。一个人不可能忍受得了长时间吃同样的东西，特别是在他知道他可以担负起更好的东西的时候。这只是一个建议，先生，既是我的也是其他人的，也许我们应该增加自己的粮食储备，这样就不会每顿饭都……嗯，这样。%SPEECH_OFF%他放下碗走开了。 | 你的几个佣兵围着营火抱怨着。你待在能听到话的位置，仔细听他们可能会说的一些不会当面跟你说的话。值得庆幸的是，这不是一场正在进行的叛乱，而是一系列对食物的批评。战团食品库存的品种实在是太少了。他们早已厌倦了一遍又一遍地吃同样的东西。也许这可以在%companyname%下一个拜访的城镇中得到补救？}",
