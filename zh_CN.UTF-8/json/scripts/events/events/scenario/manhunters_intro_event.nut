The riverlike flow of persons is as natural an economy as any raw material.\n\nPrisoners of war make up the bulk of your outfit, beaten men who must submit to and fight for another force: your own. Criminals and general riff raff fill in here and there, easy pickings from smaller villages who don't have the means to handle their resident reprobates.
