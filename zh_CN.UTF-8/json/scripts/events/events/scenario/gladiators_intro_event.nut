    "translation": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_147.png[/img]{杀死一个人本是小事一桩，然而陌生能使肉体坚韧：凶手们在街上被捉住，扼紧喉咙，拉住臂膀，钳住双手，嚷嚷着为什么他们的受害者没有死。 母亲的遗产被毁了，一遍又一遍的用火钩击打她的丈夫，而他在火星熄灭后仍长叹连连。 一个无聊的维齐尔不知道为什么他的施虐者们要和一个罪犯搏斗，而那个疯狂的人嘲笑他们被阉割了最重要的附属物。\n\n但是对于角斗士来说，一个人不仅仅是一个人，他还是一个武器的使用者。 剑，斧，矛，三叉戟等等。 当你略过这些显而易见的辩护，他仅仅是最熟悉不过的肉体，驱使他的不是斗争而是为了娱乐。娱乐！ 和比赛里各色肤色的人们竞争，以及人群的狂欢。 这些都是你喜爱的事物。 让哲学家们继续谈论事物生死存亡的本质吧。 当你把剑猛插进一些蠢货的脖子中时，不仅有鲜血喷涌到了你的锋刃之上，亦有人群喷涌出对你的成就的欢呼赞美之声！ 这是世界上最美妙的声音！ 追随而来的女人们，如此热辣令人苦恼，她们甚至不等你清理干净内脏就要开干？荣耀啊。\n\n但是事情也渐渐变得枯燥。 已经发生多少场战斗？ 你数不清了。有过多少挑战？ 你甚至连一次都说不出。 一次都没有！%g1%，%g2%，和 %g3% 都同意，是你太优秀了。 要说实话的话他们也同样很棒。 不过你们四个都同意：你们应该离开竞技场在整个世界塑造冠军之魂。\n\n角斗士们有一些奢侈的癖好，特别是香薰浴和刻有他们名字的珠宝首饰，所以当你为他们在舒适的城邦之外的奢华生活方式提供资金时，请准备好为他们支付一笔可观的费用。 事实也会如此。 你的三个坚实有力但不总是伟大的战斗伙伴将展现他们的武力，而你也将面临一项新的挑战：学习如何管理战士（和你们不是一个水平的）和他们的需求。}",
