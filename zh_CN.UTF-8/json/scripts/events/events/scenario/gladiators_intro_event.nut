    "original": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_147.png[/img]{It should be a simple matter, killing a man, but unfamiliarity toughens the flesh: murderers caught in the street, choking away, arms tensed, hands clenched, screaming why won't their victims die. The motherly estate come undone, hitting her husband with the fire iron, again and again, and yet he still draws breath long after the flames have died. A bored Vizier unsure of why his torturers struggle with a criminal, the maddened man mocking them as they cut away appendages most important.\\n\\nBut to a gladiator a man is not just a man, he is a wielder of weapons. Swords, axes, spears, tridents, and more. Once you are past all these manifested defenses, he is mere flesh most familiar, and to dispatch him is not a matter of struggle, but of entertainment. Entertainment! Competition with every ounce of skin in the game, and the revelry of the crowds. These are the things you love. Let the philosophers wax on and off about the nature of how things come to live and die. When you plunge a sword into some fool's neck, not only does blood gush upon your blade, but the crowd gushes upon your accomplishment! It is the most wonderful sound in the world! And the women who come after, so hot and bothered they don't even wait for you to clean the entrails off before jumping your bones? Glorious.\\n\\nBut it gets boring, too. How many fights has it been? You can't count. How many challenges? You can't even name a single one. Not a single one! %g1%, %g2%, and %g3% all agree: you're just too good. And they're pretty good, too, if you're being honest. All four of you agree, though: you shall depart the arenas and forge a champion's spirit across the whole world.\\n\\nThe gladiators have some proclivities for the opulent, particularly for scented baths and jewelry that spells their names, so be prepared to pay a tidy sum for each as you finance their lavish lifestyles outside the comfort of the city states. And so it will be. Your three solid, but not all-time great fighting buddies will display their martial prowess, and you will be matched with a new challenge: learning how to manage warriors (who are not at your level) and their needs.}",
    "translation": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_147.png[/img]{杀死一个人本是小事一桩，然而陌生能使肉体坚韧：凶手们在街上被捉住，扼紧喉咙，拉住臂膀，钳住双手，嚷嚷着为什么他们的受害者没有死。 母亲的遗产被毁了，一遍又一遍的用火钩击打她的丈夫，而他在火星熄灭后仍长叹连连。 一个无聊的维齐尔不知道为什么他的施虐者们要和一个罪犯搏斗，而那个疯狂的人嘲笑他们被阉割了最重要的附属物。\\n\\n但是对于角斗士来说，一个人不仅仅是一个人，他还是一个武器的使用者。 剑，斧，矛，三叉戟等等。 当你略过这些显而易见的辩护，他仅仅是最熟悉不过的肉体，驱使他的不是斗争而是为了娱乐。娱乐！ 和比赛里各色肤色的人们竞争，以及人群的狂欢。 这些都是你喜爱的事物。 让哲学家们继续谈论事物生死存亡的本质吧。 当你把剑猛插进一些蠢货的脖子中时，不仅有鲜血喷涌到了你的锋刃之上，亦有人群喷涌出对你的成就的欢呼赞美之声！ 这是世界上最美妙的声音！ 追随而来的女人们，如此热辣令人苦恼，她们甚至不等你清理干净内脏就要开干？荣耀啊。\\n\\n但是事情也渐渐变得枯燥。 已经发生多少场战斗？ 你数不清了。有过多少挑战？ 你甚至连一次都说不出。 一次都没有！%g1%，%g2%，和 %g3% 都同意，是你太优秀了。 要说实话的话他们也同样很棒。 不过你们四个都同意：你们应该离开竞技场在整个世界塑造冠军之魂。\\n\\n角斗士们有一些奢侈的癖好，特别是香薰浴和刻有他们名字的珠宝首饰，所以当你为他们在舒适的城邦之外的奢华生活方式提供资金时，请准备好为他们支付一笔可观的费用。 事实也会如此。 你的三个坚实有力但不总是伟大的战斗伙伴将展现他们的武力，而你也将面临一项新的挑战：学习如何管理战士（和你们不是一个水平的）和他们的需求。}",
