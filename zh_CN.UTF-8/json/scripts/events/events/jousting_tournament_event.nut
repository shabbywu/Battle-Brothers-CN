Squires hurry to and fro, carrying great armfulls of armor and weapons, and some step slowly about with enormous lances hefted over their shoulders. Other men brush very regal looking horses, many of which wear breastplates decorated with sigils. In the distance, you listen to brief gallops, heavy hooves stamping roughshod and lumbering and then there's a snapping twang of wood on metal and cheers erupt.\n\nAs you look about the festivities, a nobleman walks up and stops you. Weighing a purse in one hand and twisting a piece of broomstraw about the corner of his mouth with the other, he asks if you'd like to make a wager. You ask what for. He nods, pointing toward %jouster% who is across the mustering point signing himself into the tourney. Apparently he is to face this nobleman's own rider, a man by the name of %opponent%.%SPEECH_ON%A little bit of gamesmanship never hurt, no? How does %bet% crowns sound to you? Winner take all, of course.%SPEECH_OFF%\""
