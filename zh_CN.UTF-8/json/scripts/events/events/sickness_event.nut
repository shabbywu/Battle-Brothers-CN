    "original": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_08.png[/img] Your breath appears before you as though it were carried in purses of grey. It started slowly, this pain. Spits of snow. Winds that had come from ancient glaciers. One step sank your foot deep into the white powder and it was then you knew the rest of the journey would be a test of endurance.\n\nYou wonder how the men of old did it, living in these parts. They sat around campfires with all the world out to get them. Sat in the darkness surrounded by flurries of ice. Sat in isolation. They were born here, that must have been their trick. Ignorance was their warmth. Only a man who knows no better could live in a place such as this.\n\nThe men of the %companyname% stagger and fall and don't get back up with quite the speed they used to. A few have taken to coughing fits and others look about ready to succumb to exhaustion. Only the strongest of the bunch carry on with no problem. It is those men who surely share a link with the ancestors of this horrid land.",

The %companyname% express their collective discomfort as more men wretch and gag. This truly is no place for man to be. | While teeming with disgusting forms of life, the swamp actually smells of noxious death. Seemingly toxic steam undulates off the bog's still currents.
