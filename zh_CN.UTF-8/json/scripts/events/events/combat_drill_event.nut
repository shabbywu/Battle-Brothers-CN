When every single one of them picks up a sword, the old guard yells at them, stating that not every foe hankering for you being graveyard dead is gonna be wielding the exact same blade. A few nod before hurriedly exchanging their swords for axes and spears. With the crew equipped, the training begins. Mostly, %oldguard% teaches basics like how a formation makes it easier to defend not only one another, but also yourself.%SPEECH_ON%Ye need not watch corner-to-corner if ya know a brother is by yer side. But if yer separated, if yer all out there by yer lonesome, then ye might be proper farked lest ye got a heretofore unknown way with a blade which I'll go ahead and assume ye don't.%SPEECH_OFF%The training moves to offense where %oldguard% shows a few tricks with various weapons.%SPEECH_ON%With swords ye can slash, cut, stab, and riposte. Proper-hard to miss with a sword, given every side of it is a killin' side. If I see any of you trying to cut down an arrow with a sword like the fairy tales told ya I'mma beat ya down myself. It ain't true, so stop fancying it!\\n\\nSpears are good for keeping distance. They won't do much to armor, but they'll keep ya safe. Just point this sharp-end away from ya. If an armored brute gets past this pointy end here then yer probably proper farked so don't let that happen.\\n\\nFinally, there's the axe. Just pretend the other man is a tree and cleave it so. Now let's practice!%SPEECH_OFF%",
