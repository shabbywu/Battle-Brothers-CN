His first step on the pond sends an icy warble clear across the underbelly of the frozen sheet. He tests his footing again. The ice shifts and chitters, but it does not crack. With every step, the sellsword measures his own weight and its likelihood to collapse the ice - all the meanwhile, making sure he doesn't step on one of the corpses littered about. \n\n He successfully gets to the undead knight. Icicles dangle off its sword, the blade itself encapsulated in a layer of ice. The sellsword grabs the blade and yanks. The undead knight's arm lurches forward and breaks off at the elbow, sending the sellsword arse-skating backward across the pond. He slides up against the edge where your men help him up.
