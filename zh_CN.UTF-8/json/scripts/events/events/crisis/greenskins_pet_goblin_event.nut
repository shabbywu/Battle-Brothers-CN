Crouching before the greenskin, the hermit extends a hand.%SPEECH_ON%Hey there, buddy.%SPEECH_OFF%As he reaches to unshackle the greenskin, the goblin growls and launches forward, sinking its teeth into the man's face. You rush into the cabin and kick the goblin back. It lands against the corner, flesh and blood hanging from its lips. %randombrother% stabs a sword through the creature's face. The old man cries out, his face a visage of gore.%SPEECH_ON%You were right, I knew it true, but my heart... it's in so much pain.%SPEECH_OFF%Getting a better look, you now see a seeping crimson chasm where his nose should be. As the hermit crawls into a ball, he points across the cabin.%SPEECH_ON%Beneath the floorboards there, where the dust is unsettled. I've no use for it anymore.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and tell %randombrother% to fix the man up. The rest of the company starts ripping out the floorboards to look beneath the crawlspace. After getting what they need, you tell the men it's time to leave. The hermit returns to his rocking chair and takes a seat. He's got his hands face up on his knees, blood running down the lengths of the fingers, and more blood dripping from a wound that is sure to fester. You can hear the blood choking him on every breath.%SPEECH_ON%I should've hidden away. That's what I always do. Why didn't I hide?%SPEECH_OFF%\""
