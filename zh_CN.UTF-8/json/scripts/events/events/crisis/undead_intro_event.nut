    "original": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_84.png[/img]You put your head down for a nap.\n\n The silky bedsheet slides off your body as you roll to a side. Birds flutter past a sleek, ivory-framed window. A voice pours into your ear, a hint of an aroma you've never smelled before gracing you.%SPEECH_ON%You're awake.%SPEECH_OFF%A woman rolls herself over, running a finger down your chest before going back up and seizing your chin. Lithe, pretty, the sun glowing across her smooth face, and lighting up a set of emerald eyes. She goes for a kiss. You quickly slide out of the bed and frantically look around. She grips the sheets and comes to her knees, confused.%SPEECH_ON%What's wrong? Where are you going my Emperor?%SPEECH_OFF%Looking up, you see a ceiling that stretches so far up you can hardly even see the artwork which has been exquisitely embroidered there. You open a door and step out onto a balcony. Impossibly tall buildings, red, white, gold banners, a horizon steepled with black shapes stretching as far as the eye wishes to see. Domes, fountains, great arches, statues that stand so tall they seem to be commanding the structures as soldiers. Atop each roof is a garden greater and more flush than anything you've seen in the eternal springs of nature itself. Suddenly, two men emerges at your sides with cages of doves and let them out. The birds desperately scatter and just then a roar erupts beneath you. Great crowds of people jumping and waving banners around.%SPEECH_ON%They love their Emperor.%SPEECH_OFF%The woman speaks from the doorway.%SPEECH_ON%Go to them.%SPEECH_OFF%You look down to see a stream of soldiers marching down the middle of the road, each man stepping in unison with his brother, a steady staccato clap of boots. Their faces stern in their gilded helms, long polearms glistening upward as though they meant to defeat their enemies with opulence itself.%SPEECH_ON%They're going off to war. To face the Great Beyond, and to defeat it.%SPEECH_OFF%The woman is at your side. She smiles warmly, taking you by the arm. You feel ready to agree to it, to this new reality, whatever it be. You take her by the cheek, ready to fall into her embrace, but a cry from below wails loud and clear over all else. You glance down to see the soldiers, once joined in perfect uniformity, breaking rank. In the distance, a great mountain is erupting, jetting great bursts of red fire and an enormous cloud of hot ash which quickly pools into the city. Buildings disintegrate, gardens burst into flames, and the people... the people scream. They turn away, but there is no escaping the heat. The soldiers collapse and scream. A surging, searing heat, and soon enough you see the denizens melting in it, the soldiers becoming metal golems, singed into the very armor which was meant to protect them, and the unarmored crowds simply burst aflame. The woman cries at your side.%SPEECH_ON%Oh, it is horrible! Horrible! Would you look at it? But it's okay, understand? It's perfectly okay. Look at me. Look at me!%SPEECH_OFF%The woman grabs you and spins you. Her once soft features have hardened into blackened flakes, the top of her head already burnt bald, her teeth falling out of dripping gums. Yet she's grinning.%SPEECH_ON%We'll rise again, Emperor! We... shall... rise... again!%SPEECH_OFF%Her skull breaks apart and her body collapses into a pile of burning bones.\n\n You jerk awake to find %randombrother% shaking you.%SPEECH_ON%Sir, wakeup! We've got a group of refugees here saying that the dead are rising from the earth and killing everything in sight!%SPEECH_OFF%The woman's face flashes before your eyes. It is horrifically scarred, but this doesn't stop her from grinning.%SPEECH_ON%The Empire rises.%SPEECH_OFF%",
    "translation": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_84.png[/img]你低下头准备打个盹。\n\n 你翻个身，丝质的被单溜了出去。 有鸟飞过镶有象牙的窗棂。 仿佛有一种浸在前所未有的优雅芳香里的声音侵入你的耳朵。%SPEECH_ON%你醒啦。%SPEECH_OFF%一个女人翻过身，沿着你胸前纤纤玉指轻轻向下游离，复又逆行而上攫取你的下巴。 轻盈而又美丽，阳光映照在她光洁的脸上，绿宝石般的眼眸熠熠生辉。 她向你索吻。 你狂乱地滚下床，四下张望。 她攥着床单跪在床上，非常疑惑。%SPEECH_ON%怎么了？你要去哪我的帝王？%SPEECH_OFF%抬起头，你看到一个天花板，那么宽广你甚至看不清可称为艺术品的精致花边。 你打开一扇门，走到阳台上。 难以置信的高耸群楼，红，白和金色的旗帜，一直延伸到目之所及凝成黑色形状的奇点。 穹顶，喷泉，巨大的拱门，以及高高耸立的雕像，如此雄伟好像它们就像统领士兵一样指挥着建筑群。 每个屋顶上都有一个花园，比你在永恒的春天里看到的任何自然形成的花园都要更大，更壮观。 这时两个男人从你身边冒出来，放出提着的笼子里的鸽子。 鸟儿们拼命四散飞出去，在你脚下发出尖啸。 周围的人群雀跃着挥舞起旗帜。%SPEECH_ON%他们爱戴他们的帝王。%SPEECH_OFF%那个女人出现在门口。%SPEECH_ON%去迎接他们吧。%SPEECH_OFF%你低头一看，只见一群士兵正沿着大路行进，每个人都和队友的步调一致，靴子踏着地面发出整齐的步伐声。 囿于镀金的头盔里的是坚定的神色，长长的长柄武器向上泛起着阳光般的色泽，仿佛他们要用财富本身来击败敌人。%SPEECH_ON%他们整装待发。 准备迎击远大的未来，并征服它。%SPEECH_OFF%女人待你身边。 温和地笑着，挽着你的胳膊。 无论这个新现实是什么，你都准备好接受它了。 你把她的脸颊握在手心里，正准备拥她入怀，但从下面传来清晰响亮的惨叫却地盖过了一切。 你往下看了一眼，曾经列着整齐划一队形已经不复存在。 远处，一座大山正在爆发，喷出大量的红色火焰和满天的巨大的灼热灰烬，炼狱很快涌进城市。 建筑物分崩离析，花园被火焰吞噬，人们…人们尖叫着。 逃跑，但是没人能逃脱炼狱。 士兵们尖叫着脱离了阵型。 随着一股灼热、汹涌的热浪，很快你就看到居民们融化在这股热浪之中，士兵们变成了金属像，原本保护他们的盔甲也被烧焦，而没有盔甲保护的人群直接燃烧起来。 女人在你身边尖叫起来。%SPEECH_ON%噢，太恐怖了！太恐怖了！ 你看到了吗？ 但没关系，明白吗？ 完全没关系。 看着我，看着我！%SPEECH_OFF%那个女人伸出手抱住你。 她那曾经柔美的面容已经成了焦黑的薄片，头顶业燃烧枯涸，牙龈和牙齿都在破碎离析。如此，她仍然咧开嘴笑着。%SPEECH_ON%我们会复兴的，帝王！ 我们…终将…重拾…荣光！%SPEECH_OFF%她的颅骨崩溃了，身体也崩塌成一堆燃烧着的骨头。\n\n 你一个激灵醒来，发现 %randombrother% 在摇你。%SPEECH_ON%先生，醒醒，我们在这碰到一群难民说死者从地里复活起来，见一个杀一个！%SPEECH_OFF%女人的脸在你眼前一闪而过。 带着可怕的伤疤，但这没阻止她的笑容。%SPEECH_ON%帝国复生了。%SPEECH_OFF%",
