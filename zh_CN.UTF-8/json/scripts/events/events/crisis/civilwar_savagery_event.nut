Just keep on walking.%SPEECH_OFF% | The march of the %companyname% is suddenly interrupted when you come across a band of men carrying the banner of %noblehouse%. Unfortunately, carrying a banner isn't the only thing they are doing - they've lined up peasants of a nearby hamlet and look prepared to slaughter them all. The lieutenant of the troop stares you down.%SPEECH_ON%Let's not get messy, mercenary. I suggest you keep on walking.%SPEECH_OFF% | You come to a hovel. A few bannermen of %noblehouse% are standing guard outside its door. Inside, you hear the screams of a woman and man. The lieutenant steps out and sees you. He fixes himself, even combing his hair back, and tells you to git.%SPEECH_ON%Don't start nothing, sellsword. Just keep on keeping on.%SPEECH_OFF% | You come to sort of holy temple, sacred to this old god or that. A few bannermen of %noblehouse% are boarding up the door while their lieutenant waves around a torch. People are screaming for mercy inside the building.

This ain't your show.%SPEECH_OFF% | While stepping down a path, you come across a lieutenant of %noblehouse%. He's got a couple of women standing on stools beneath a tree. They've got ropes around their necks and tears down from their eyes. The lieutenant glares at you.%SPEECH_ON%Don't get any heroic ideas, sellsword. This ain't your business.%SPEECH_OFF% | While marching, you suddenly hear the shrill cries of children. Their baying draws you near, and you find them on one side of the road while on the other their parents are kneeling beneath about a dozen executioners' swords. A lieutenant of %noblehouse% stands nearby, proudly holding up his noble house's banner. He stares at you.%SPEECH_ON%Oh, sellsword. Have you come to watch? I hope so, because you best not intervene. This is not your fight.%SPEECH_OFF% | Needing a piss, you climb a nearby hill for a little privacy, but mostly just to get your thoughts in order. Sadly, that won't be happening. Down the opposite slopes stand a number of men from %noblehouse%, following the barking orders of their lieutenant who squats not far from where you were going to piss. The troops are rounding up women from a couple of hovels stitched into an adjacent hillside. The men of the hamlet are already slain, dead in the grass here and there. Little more than blotchy lumps at this distance.\\n\\n The lieutenant looks up at you.%SPEECH_ON%Hello there, sellsword, nice day, no?%SPEECH_OFF%He must have seen the disconcerting look on your face as his own soon sours.%SPEECH_ON%Hey. Listen. Don't be getting any ideas of heroism, yeah? Just keep on walking. I've seen that look before and if you don't put it away there'll be trouble for all of us.%SPEECH_OFF% | While walking a path, you hear the baying of some hounds. Apparently, a band of men from %noblehouse% have cleared out a few hovels and all that's left are the poor mongrels holed up in a kennel. There's a few soldiers standing outside it with torches, ready to set every mutt ablaze. A lieutenant stands nearby, a horrid grin on his face, though it quickly fades upon seeing you.%SPEECH_ON%Oh, you a dog lover or something? Don't give me that look. You'd best keep to stepping, sellsword, or I'll treat you like one of these dogs here.%SPEECH_OFF% | During times of war, roads are often the worst places to be - they bring the terror to and fro and today is no different.

As you walk up, the soldiers' lieutenant turns to get a look at you.%SPEECH_ON%Hey, if you don't like what you see, then keep on marching. This is war, what did you expect? Now get outta here, we got a fire to start.%SPEECH_OFF% | While trudging down a path off the main roads, keeping clear of the carnage that a civil war will wrought, you come to find a few soldiers of %noblehouse% torturing a man. They've lit torches partially wrapped in leather and are letting the scraps of burning hot strips fall onto their poor prisoner. He's screaming for mercy, but they've certainly have none for him. Seeing you, though, he calls out, begging for help. One of the soldiers turns to you.%SPEECH_ON%Like what you see? My father made this form of torture up. You just let the fiery leather drip all over them. Much better than just simple little embers.%SPEECH_OFF%}",
