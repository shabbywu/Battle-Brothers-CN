    "original": "{[img]gfx/ui/events/event_22.png[/img]A canopy billowing loosely across leaning tentpoles, given ghostly life by the moans of the men lingering beneath.  You watch as elder healers go from wounded to wounded, but there isn't much to be done here. Passing their hands in the shape of aerial rites, these elder healers think it best that these fallen and falling warriors go into the next realm protected from whatever spirits lay beyond. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_21.png[/img]You come across two men laying by the side of a small road. They kick back at the sight of you, one raising a sword. It wobbles in his hand until he can no longer muster the strength to keep it up.%SPEECH_ON%Just let us die in peace.%SPEECH_OFF%A few more men emerge under the banner of %randomnoblehouse%. They nod and tell you to get on.%SPEECH_ON%Keep it moving, strangers.%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_88.png[/img]Both sides of the road are lined with wounded warriors, armored men splayed out, hands draped across their foreheads or clutching the nubs left over from limbs gone missing. In a nearby field there are signs of what battle had brought them to this state of grisly being. This sad lot of men, apparently, 'won' that fight. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_22.png[/img]You find a few noblemen of %randomnoblehouse% peering over a sea of skewered and slain men - apparently you just missed some epic battle. Amongst the dead and dying you watch as swordsman pick through the enemy wounded and finish them off. A few guards head you off.%SPEECH_ON%This ain't your war. Keep on moving or we'll make it yours.%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]You come across a few noblemen standing atop a hill. Guards immediately rush to you, swords drawn.%SPEECH_ON%Do you belong here?%SPEECH_OFF%You look beyond the group to see that scribes are writing down notes. And beyond the scribes lays a scene of incredible destruction, great swathes of dead men from some pointless battle or another.%SPEECH_ON%I asked you a question, stranger.%SPEECH_OFF%You glance back at the guard. The noblemen are also looking down at you now. Shaking your head, you order the %companyname% to get moving before y'all get into another ordeal. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_21.png[/img]You come across a woman cleaning the wounds of a well armored man. He's got some decent equipment on him, and a pair of very dim eyes stare up at you from the faceguard. Drawing out your sword, you tell the woman to step aside so you can finish the job and collect the goods. She shakes her head.%SPEECH_ON%If it's the armor you're interested in you'll have pay better attention. This man fought under the banner of %randomnoblehouse%, the rest of which stand over that hill yonder. They so much as peer over it while you shake us down, they'll be skewering you on stakes and hanging you for the crows.%SPEECH_OFF%Suspicious, you lock eyes with her. The woman doesn't so much as flinch, but she does eventually move away from the wounded man.%SPEECH_ON%If you think I'm lying, then have at it. Go on, take his life and take his gear.%SPEECH_OFF%You shake your head and tell the %companyname% to get going. No more than a few feet further up the road do you see what is seemingly half an army of the noble house's men lingering. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_88.png[/img]A few soldiers hobble past you on the road. Healers are tending to their wounds, and a few women bound after them, sobbing or moaning into their fisted hands. One of the men pauses at the sight of you.%SPEECH_ON%Don't try anything, mercenary. The rest of %randomnoblehouse%'s army marches just yonder.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and let the wounded troop pass. The army never does appear. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_07.png[/img]You come across a man being hounded by scoundrels. Seeing you, the thieves quickly take the fallen man's boots, pants, and bits of armor and one lopes off with a sword, the blade leveled across raised arms like some heretical thaumaturge carrying a relic of impossible yet brittle power.\n\n When you get to the wounded soldier he raises his hands to the sky, your silhouette no doubt blurred between his splayed fingers. He says something which you do not hear and then he is dead. There is nothing else to take from him. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]A wounded man is sitting up against a signpost. He nods at you as you near.%SPEECH_ON%Mercenaries?%SPEECH_OFF%As you get closer, you see the sigil of %randomnoblehouse% stitched across an unfurled and trampled banner. You don't answer his question, instead looking around for an ambush or soldiers from his house. There are none. And the man himself has been stripped to his skivvies. He coughs and shifts as though to tilt the pain from one end of his body to the other.%SPEECH_ON%Yeah, I suppose you don't have to answer. I'll be dead soon anyhow. I'd feel a lot better if you didn't stick around to watch.%SPEECH_OFF%A pleading eye meets yours. With pity, you leave the man to a peaceful, lonely death. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_16.png[/img]You find a crippled man crawling toward a dead cow. He's got the banner of %randomnoblehouse% trailing behind him, a messied and shredded coattail if there ever was one. You watch as he nestls against the bosom of the animal and begins to suck on its teat. He tries each grayed nub in turn, though not a drop of milk is to be had for Death is the driest of counties. Sighing, he flops over and finally sees you.%SPEECH_ON%Ah hell, don't look at me like that.%SPEECH_OFF%You offer water and he takes a sip.%SPEECH_ON%Dreadful. I guess I won't miss this place much.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and think to speak, but you notice the man is staring straight ahead, his arms flat at his sides, and a couple of flies got news of his passing before you did. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]You come across a naked man clothed only in the torn banner of %randomnoblehouse%. A large black bird is eating his feet. He stares at it, then at you, explaining himself in embarrassment.%SPEECH_ON%It asked if it could have a bite.%SPEECH_OFF%You raise an eyebrow.%SPEECH_ON%And you said yes?%SPEECH_OFF%The man shrugs.%SPEECH_ON%I don't remember what I said.%SPEECH_OFF%With a crack, the beak rips off a toe. You look back at the man, but he's slowly tilting over, the light faded from his eyes. The bird hops up to his head where there be easier pickings. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_94.png[/img]Walls of smoke curl beyond the eaves of a burning farmstead. The owners are all dead in the grass. A dog howls wildly and then runs off at the sight of you, as though you were there to finish the job. %randombrother% nods into a pile of weeds.%SPEECH_ON%They didn't even spare the youngins.%SPEECH_OFF%You spit and shake your head.%SPEECH_ON%No, they did not.%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_30.png[/img]Tufts of grey smoke pipe over a hill. Cresting it, you discover a farmstead ablaze. A few souls hang from a nearby tree. Their necks show signs of desperation - their hands were not bound - and footprints in the earth show that whoever did this probably watched them die. A dead dog is at the base of the tree and another headless mutt swings by its feet. Fresh blood still drips. %randombrother% comes up to your side.%SPEECH_ON%We should get going, sir, before something thinks us the perpetrators here.%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_71.png[/img]You come upon a smoldering farmstead. There are bodies amongst the wood, though the charred ruin all looks the same to you. %randombrother% joins you.%SPEECH_ON%Searched the area, sir. Didn't find nothin' worth taking. Whoever did this was quite thorough.%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_78.png[/img]%randombrother% points toward the horizon, more particularly toward tufts of smoke wafting lazily over a hillcrest.%SPEECH_ON%Should we go check it out?%SPEECH_OFF%A few riders, well-armed and with lances so long and large you know they seek only one thing - enormous and pitched battles. Not wanting to risk running into those responsible, and whatever army might be with them, you tell the men to stay low and carry on. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]A horse ablaze, scattering down the road hawing and crackling like some nightmare fetched from a desert sleep. You watch as the animal buckles and goes headfirst into a ditch where it rolls and pitches, stands, stumbles, and finally goes still.\n\n Turning down the road, you come to find a stable consumed by fires and a nearby hovel burnt to cinders. A few laymen are dead in the grass and their dogs, goats, and sheep and all else is there with them. You're not sure which side of the realm's war is responsible for this, but you've no desire to stick around and find out. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_54.png[/img]You come upon a hovel with fires blazing forth from its windows. There's a body in the grass, skinned and, by the looks on its face, it was a slow treatment.\n\n Suddenly, the door to the home kicks open and a man on fire stumbles out. He takes one look at you and your men, screams, and simply goes back inside. The roof collapses and whatever terror was born here finally dies. You tell the %companyname% to get moving lest someone, or some large army, come to think it was you who did this. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_22.png[/img]You come across a soldier standing with his hands tented over the end of a spiked spear. He nods at you.%SPEECH_ON%'Ello. If I were you, I'd keep moving.%SPEECH_OFF%Looking around, you ask what the man is doing out here.%SPEECH_ON%Keeping watch for the army of %randomnoble%. We is at war, don'tcha know?%SPEECH_OFF%He spits and throws his hand out to the horizon.%SPEECH_ON%Rest of the army stands thataway. So I'd fly like a crooked bee and go around.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and take the man's advice. Sure enough, you eventually skirt around the edge of an enormous military camp. | An old man is founding squatting in the middle of a path. He's eating nuts and mushrooms. He looks up at you.%SPEECH_ON%More of %randomnoblehouse%'s soldiers?%SPEECH_OFF%You shake your head.%SPEECH_ON%Mercenaries.%SPEECH_OFF%The man cocks his head.%SPEECH_ON%Didn't know there was a difference.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod.%SPEECH_ON%We do not fly a noble banner.%SPEECH_OFF%The man jaws on a nut.%SPEECH_ON%Ah, yes, pressed into battle by way of gold. You fly the most common banner of all, soldier. Would you like a mushroom?%SPEECH_OFF%He holds one up. It is mushed and muddied. You decline and order the men to get to marching again. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_37.png[/img]You come across a few men flying the %randomnoblehouse% banner. They're yanking dogs at the ends of their leashes, and the dogs are being separated from corpses, leashes of flesh pulled between their teeth and the bodies. Spotting you, one of the soldiers tells you off.%SPEECH_ON%We ain't got money for your services, mercenary, but I'll put an axe in that dumb face of yours if you don't move on.%SPEECH_OFF%There are far, far too many soldiers around to respond to that so you just nod and move on. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_36.png[/img]You spot a shepherd herding goats along a hillside. He spots you and waves.%SPEECH_ON%This is not the safest place for folks like me.%SPEECH_OFF%He kicks one of the goats along. It bays and blurts and froths, but moves along all the same, clambering and shuffling amongst its brothers. The man shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%This war between the noble houses has brought so much bloodshed to this land.%SPEECH_OFF%The shepherd boots along another of his flock.%SPEECH_ON%I guess it's only a matter of time until they come to me looking for milk, and then for meat, and then for me. Just another warm body thrown into the thresher these nobles call a 'grand honor' or some such shite.%SPEECH_OFF%You let the man and his herd pass before continuing on yourself. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_71.png[/img]You come across a man standing aside the ruins of what appear to be his home.%SPEECH_ON%Well, there goes all I had.%SPEECH_OFF%He seems rather calm about the whole affair. He spits and looks around.%SPEECH_ON%Hope they didn't take off with my dog.%SPEECH_OFF%The man lets out a sharp whistle, pauses, then nods grimly.%SPEECH_ON%Suppose they did.%SPEECH_OFF%He goes over his charcoaled hovel and begins to kick the wooden frames away.%SPEECH_ON%Excuse me, sir mercenary, I need to rebuild so that those damned %randomnoblehouse% grunts have something else to knock over the next time they come around. By the way, if you ever see a dog, any kind of dog, send it my way. Your company's nice, but I prefer the muttly sort of companionship.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and go on your way. Not far off you do find a dog, but it is in no state to be returned to anyone. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_30.png[/img]A fire consumes a farmstead, and the pyros responsible are just riding over a hill yonder. When they leave, you rush to the home and come to hear screams inside. The door has been jammed with shut with a wooden post. You kick it aside and instantly fires burst forth and a woman scatters out from the flames. She is in tatters, smoky and charcoaled and ghastly orange. It is too late. She falls into the grass and you can only step away.\n\n The hovel cracks and then collapses. A man barks out to you.%SPEECH_ON%Like what you see, mercenary? Why don't you go on and get going.%SPEECH_OFF%It's the bannermen of %randomnoblehouse% and there are far too many soldiers to start any sort of battle. You get on going. | The trees that line the path are creaking with ropes weighted with corpses. Every branch has found a use in this vocation - you count at least a dozen bodies swinging, most with sacks over their heads. The house words of %randomnoblehouse% have been carved into the base of the tree. There's a sort of haughty confidence in the typography. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]A few soldiers of %randomnoblehouse% stand beside a tree. It is caked with blood from treetop to its roots. You can hear the squash of the soldiers' boots as they step through it.%SPEECH_ON%Say, mercenary, do you think the dead could fertilize new trees?%SPEECH_OFF%The man sounds awfully educated to be a murderous soldier, but really you have no idea what fertilize means. You simply nod. He nods in return.%SPEECH_ON%Yeah, I figured as much. Well, I suppose in a couple years there's gonna be a whole forest thataway.%SPEECH_OFF%He points toward some distance, silhouettes of horror stacked high in the grass. The man bursts into laughter. You tell your men to get going before something stupid goes down. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]You come to find a few trees along the path have been cut down and their stumps sawed into spikes. This wasn't an artistic matter - bodies have been spiked there, grisly and cruel, faces appropriately contorted to the horrors that met them in the end. A few bannermen of %randomnoblehouse% stand nearby, seemingly happy with their work.%SPEECH_ON%Hey, mercenary. 'Wood' you please kindly move along?%SPEECH_OFF%He laughs and turns to the rest of his men.%SPEECH_ON%Get it?%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_95.png[/img]Moving along a path, you come across a bodies all clumped together. They're lying face down and naked. Wounds pepper their backs, superficial until they weren't. Whoever did this wanted to exact some amount of pain on these poor folks - and those creatures of crueler stock might still be around. You spot a banner of %randomnoblehouse% laying in the mud just nearby. That's enough to spur the %companyname% along before it can find trouble. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_75.png[/img]A few mounds of earth mottle the sides of the path you are on. Some mudworn shovels are nearby, and you can't help but notice that a hand is sticking forth from one of the graves. Uncovering it, you find a naked corpse, mouth full of dirt and beetles. You need not uncover the rest to know they're in a similar state. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]You come to find a body crucified to a signpost with %randomnoblehouse%'s sigil carved into his forehead. His hands help aide you in finding a nearby town, though his open mouth seems to shout to not go there. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_88.png[/img]Along the road lay rows of wounded men from one of %randomnoblehouse%'s armies. You watch as an elderly healer walks the lines, drill and scalpel in hand, tending to those souls who are loudest. He sets himself upon a particularly shrill fellow who is clutching a green and puckered nub where one of his legs used to be.\n\n The healer holds the wounded soldier down and with no trepidation in his trephination he begins to bore a hole into the man's skull. You wince at the screams. A moonly fluid seeps from the brainpan, chips of bone coursing along the froth, and as the sickly blue ruin pours over the man's face he appears to smile and be at ease, as though peace came by way of an augered and fevered dream. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_88.png[/img]A few of %randomnoblehouse%'s bannermen line up to see an elderly healer. You watch as the old man turns his patients this way and that, pressing his thumbs into their flesh, smelling their clothes, their hair, their blood. His summations are scribed into a scroll no one can see, and then he moves the men off to a side. You ask a lieutenant what is going on. He explains.%SPEECH_ON%We are seeing who is still fit to fight. If you are not fit, you go to the left, if you are fit, you go to the right.%SPEECH_OFF%Slowly, you realize not a single man is put to the left. Not even the one-legged or blind or wheezing. The lieutenant grins.%SPEECH_ON%I told the healer my requirements for going to the right and he seems to be following them satisfactorily.%SPEECH_OFF%You ask what those requirements might be. The lieutenant raises an eyebrow.%SPEECH_ON%Why, they must be breathing, of course! Don't tell the men that, though. Illusions of relaxation is nothing but decay to an army!%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_71.png[/img]A man is found along a path. He's missing both his legs, the nubs of their trunks in each hand as though he had no idea how he'd come to this state. With pitiful eyes, he glances up at you.%SPEECH_ON%What happened?%SPEECH_OFF%You shake your head. Seeing the banner of %randomnoblehouse%, though, you gather that he was attacked in the midst of the war amongst the nobles. The wounded man coughs and a rope of red spurts from one of the stumps. His face goes pale.%SPEECH_ON%Huh, I feel much better now. I think I'll do that again.%SPEECH_OFF%He gathers his breath to cough, smiles, and falls over. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_53.png[/img]You find a few men crawling about naked. They're dragging innards and loosely tethered limbs behind them, moaning and groaning like the refuse of a medical ward come alive. One glances up at you, the banner of %randomnoblehouse% stuffed into his mouth.%SPEECH_ON%Please...%SPEECH_OFF%He collapses. Another man grabs onto your boot, but you shake him off and he, too, dies in the moment. The rest stop moving one by one in turn. It appears as though they sought you as a savior and, upon getting the bad news, they died in disappointed union. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_75.png[/img]A man's slathered in blood, setting squat in the middle of a path, naked save for the metal knife he's biting down on. He's got gore in his hands, and mad lust in his eyes. Bodies lay nearby. Destroyed, demolished in shells of armor that they once depended upon for protection. The insane man glances at them, then at you.%SPEECH_ON%Oh, it was good fight. Oh, it was a good fight. Oh, my sirs, it was a good fight!%SPEECH_OFF%He jumps to his feet and you draw your sword, but the man turns and sprints away. You dare not catch him or his curse. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_11.png[/img]You come to a tree along the path. There's a man talking to a cat, but as you get closer you realize he's tied a rope around the fearful feline's neck.%SPEECH_ON%Purr, yes, keep purring... all will be well. I'm sorry you saw the things I did. I love your purring...%SPEECH_OFF%You raise your voice.%SPEECH_ON%Sir?%SPEECH_OFF%The second the man turns around you see that he is a bannerman of %randomnoblehouse%. Seeing its chance, the cat slips its noose and scatters. The man cries out and gives chase. Hopefully, that is the last you see of them both. |[img]gfx/ui/events/event_17.png[/img] You come to a man sitting in the road. He's got a dog nestled in his lap, though the mutt's head is hanging limp and bloodied. The man looks up at you.%SPEECH_ON%Have you seen my dog? It's black, matted, has a white tail. Have you seen my dog?%SPEECH_OFF%The pup he's describing is currently in his lap, but you do not say as much. Instead, you shake your head and tell the man a simple 'no.' He shakes his head in return.%SPEECH_ON%The bannermen of %randomnoblehouse% came by. Destroyed everything. And they took my dog. Say, have you seen my dog?%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_30.png[/img]You find a burning cottage beside the path. A few dead bodies are scattered about the grass, some of them quite small. Looking around, you do not find the perpetrators, though the banner of %randomnoblehouse% is flying from the branches of a nearby tree. The war is sparing no one. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_72.png[/img]You come to find a shepherd standing before a massacre. He's crouched, hands balanced over his knees, a cane balanced over his arms, like some fleshen clock with shadows for time. Seeing you, he speaks up and he's rather articulate, as though he's getting something long on his mind.%SPEECH_ON%Soldiers came by. I said don't kill my sheep. They said what sheep. I said nothing. They pushed me down. Went over the hill. Found my sheep. Slaughtered my sheep. Ate my sheep. I should have kept my mouth shut.%SPEECH_OFF%His thumbs twist the ends of his walking staff, but he says nothing more. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]You find a man impaled to a tree by the banner pole of his house, %randomnoblehouse%. His eyes stare at the ground before him, at a litter of footprints that seemed to have been standing around long enough to leave deep grooves in the mud. And then he departed and so did they.}",

再往前不到几英尺，你看到半支贵族家族的军队似乎还在徘徊。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_88.png[/img]几个士兵在路上从你身边蹒跚而过。 治疗师正在照料他们的伤口，几个女人在他们身后被绑着，对着他们的拳头哭泣或呻吟。 其中一个男人看到你停了下来。%SPEECH_ON%不要尝试任何事，雇佣兵。 其余 %randomnoblehouse%的军队就在那边行军。%SPEECH_OFF%你点头，让伤兵过去。 但之后军队从未出现过。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_07.png[/img]你遇到一个被歹徒追赶的人。 看到你，盗贼们很快抢走了那个倒下的人的靴子、裤子和盔甲碎片，其中一人用剑一跃而下，刀刃横在举起的手臂上，像是某种异端的屠夫携带着一种不可能但脆弱的遗俗的力量。\n\n当你走到伤兵身边时，他举起双手指向天空，你的影子无疑在他张开的手指间模糊不清。 他说了一些你听不清的话，然后就死了。 他身上已经没有东西能被夺走了。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]一个受伤的人正坐在路标旁。 你走近时，他向你点头。%SPEECH_ON%雇佣兵？%SPEECH_OFF%当你走近的时候，你看到 %randomnoblehouse% 的徽章被缝在一个展开的旗帜上。 你没有回答他的问题，而是环顾四周，看看有没有埋伏，或者他家里有没有士兵。 什么都没有。而他自己也被剥光了衣服。 他咳嗽着，变换着身体姿势，好像要把疼痛从身体的一端转移到另一端。%SPEECH_ON%是的，我想你不必回答。 无论如何，我很快就要死了。 如果你不留下来看，我会感觉好很多。%SPEECH_OFF%一双恳求的眼睛与你相遇。 带着怜悯，你离开了这个男人，让他安详而孤独地死去。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_16.png[/img]你发现一个瘸子爬向一头死牛。 他身后拖着一条 %randomnoblehouse% 的旗帜，那个旗帜看起来就像一个乱七八糟的碎燕尾。 你看着他依偎在动物的怀里，开始吮吸它的乳头。 他依次尝试每一个灰白的小块，但是没有一滴牛奶可以喝，因为死亡导致干燥的原因。 他叹了一口气，跌倒在地，终于看到了你。%SPEECH_ON%啊，见鬼，别那样看着我。%SPEECH_OFF%你给他水，他喝了一小口。%SPEECH_ON%太可怕了。我想我不会太怀念这个地方。%SPEECH_OFF%你点头，想要说话，但你注意到那个人直直地盯着前方，双臂平放在身体两侧，几只苍蝇在你之前就知道了他的死讯。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]你遇到一个赤身裸体的男人，身上只披着属于 %randomnoblehouse% 的撕破的旗帜。一只大黑鸟正在吃他的脚。 他盯着它，然后盯着你，尴尬地解释着自己。%SPEECH_ON%它问能不能咬一口。%SPEECH_OFF%你挑了挑眉毛。%SPEECH_ON%然后你说可以？%SPEECH_OFF%那人耸了耸肩。%SPEECH_ON%我不记得我有说。%SPEECH_OFF%随着一声裂纹，鸟喙撕裂了一个脚趾。 你回头看那个人，但他慢慢地倾斜过来，光线从他的眼睛里消失了。 那只鸟跳到它的头上，那里有更容易采摘的食物。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_94.png[/img]烟雾缭绕在燃烧着的农田的屋檐下。 所有人都死在草地上了。 一只狗狂吠着，一看见你就跑开了，好像这件事是你干的一样。%randombrother% 向一堆杂草点头。%SPEECH_ON%他们甚至连孩子都不放过。%SPEECH_OFF%你吐了口吐沫并摇了摇头。%SPEECH_ON%不，他们没有。%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_30.png[/img]一簇簇灰色的烟雾从山上袅袅升起。 最重要的是，你发现一个农场着火了。 附近的树上挂着几个灵魂。 他们的脖子上显示出绝望的迹象－他们的手没有被绑住－地上的脚印表明，不管是谁干的，都是可能看着他们死去的。 一只死狗躺在树下，另一只无头杂种狗在它的脚边摇摆。 新鲜的血液仍在滴落。%randombrother% 站到你身旁。%SPEECH_ON%我们得走了，先生，别让人以为我们是凶手。%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_71.png[/img]你来到一个正在燃烧的农庄。 尽管烧焦后的焦状物看起来都是一样的，但是你还是发现了在木头中间有尸体。 随后，%randombrother% 向你汇报情况。%SPEECH_ON%搜查了整个地区，先生。 没有发现任何值得带走的东西。 做这件事的人做得很彻底。%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_78.png[/img]%randombrother% 指向地平线，特别是指向山顶上飘荡的一簇簇烟雾。%SPEECH_ON%我们要去看看吗？%SPEECH_OFF%一些骑士，全副武装，装备着长而大的骑枪，你知道他们只寻求一件事－激烈的战斗。 你不想冒险撞上那些人，那些导致冒烟的人，你告诉手下要保持低调，继续前进。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]一匹马在熊熊燃烧，像沙漠中的梦魇一样，摇摇晃晃地跑在路上，吱吱作响。 你看着这只动物一个踉跄，头朝下掉进沟里，在那里翻滚、站立、绊倒，最后一动不动。\n\n沿着这条路转下去，你发现一个马厩被大火烧毁了，附近的一个小茅屋被烧成了灰烬。 有几个村民死在草地上，他们的狗、山羊、绵羊和其他一切都在那里。 你不确定这场屠杀是由王国的哪一方造成的，但你并不想留下来弄清原委。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_54.png[/img]你看见一间小屋，窗户里有熊熊燃烧的火焰。 草丛中有一具被剥了皮的尸体，从它脸上的表情来看，这是一次缓慢的处理。\n\n突然，家门被踢开了，一个着火的人跌跌撞撞地走了出来。 他看了你和你的手下一眼，尖叫着，然后就回到里面去了。 屋顶坍塌了，无论那个人在恐惧什么，现在都消失了。 你告诉 %companyname% 迅速离开，以免有人，或者一些军队，认为这件事是你干的。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_22.png[/img]你遇到一个士兵，他紧绷的双手搭在长矛上。 他向你点头。%SPEECH_ON%你好。如果我是你，我就会继续前进。%SPEECH_OFF%环顾四周，你问这个人在这里做什么。%SPEECH_ON%盯紧 %randomnoble% 的军队。 我们在打仗，你不知道吗？%SPEECH_OFF%他吐了一口唾沫，把手伸向地平线。%SPEECH_ON%其余的军队就驻扎在那边。 所以我会像一只蜜蜂一样飞来飞去。%SPEECH_OFF%你点头接受了他的建议。 果然，你最终从一个巨大的军营边绕过。 | 一位老人蹲在路中间寻找着什么。 他在吃坚果和蘑菇。 他抬头看着你。%SPEECH_ON%更多 %randomnoblehouse%的士兵？%SPEECH_OFF%你摇了摇头。%SPEECH_ON%雇佣兵。%SPEECH_OFF%那个人昂起头。%SPEECH_ON%我不知道这有什么不同。%SPEECH_OFF%你点了点头。%SPEECH_ON%我们不挂贵族的旗帜。%SPEECH_OFF%那个人咬住一颗坚果。%SPEECH_ON%唉，是的，为钱而战。 你挂着最普通的旗帜，士兵。 你想要蘑菇吗？%SPEECH_OFF%他举起其中一个。 那个已经变成糊状和泥状的了。 你拒绝并命令士兵们继续前进。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_37.png[/img]你遇到一些人挂着 %randomnoblehouse% 的旗帜。 他们拉扯着狗链，把狗从尸体中拉出来，把狗牙从尸体里拉出来。 一个士兵发现了你，命令你离开。%SPEECH_ON%雇佣兵，我们没有请你服务的钱，但是如果你不离开，我就用斧子砍你那张蠢脸。%SPEECH_OFF%周围有太多太多的士兵对此无动于衷，所以你只是点了点头，然后继续前进。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_36.png[/img]你看到一个牧羊人在山坡上放羊。 他发现了你，挥了挥手。%SPEECH_ON%对于像我这样的人来说，这不是最安全的地方。%SPEECH_OFF%他踢了一只山羊。 它口吐白沫，但仍和平常一样移动，在它的兄弟们中间爬来爬去。 他摇起头来。%SPEECH_ON%贵族家族之间的战争给这片土地带来了如此多的血腥事件。%SPEECH_OFF%牧羊人赶着他的另一群羊。%SPEECH_ON%我想他们来找我要牛奶，然后是肉，最后是我，这只是个时间问题。 只不过是被贵族以伟大荣誉或者类似的狗屁东西为理由，丢进绞肉机的温暖身体罢了。%SPEECH_OFF%你让那个人和他的羊群过去，然后继续自己的生活。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_71.png[/img]你看到一个男人站在他家的废墟旁。%SPEECH_ON%好吧，我的一切都完了。%SPEECH_OFF%他似乎对整个事件相当冷静。 他吐了口唾沫，环顾四周。%SPEECH_ON%希望他们没有把我的狗带走。%SPEECH_OFF%那个男人发出尖锐的口哨声，停顿了一下，然后严肃地点了点头。%SPEECH_ON%看来他们也带走了。%SPEECH_OFF%他走过自己的木板棚屋，开始踢开木框架。%SPEECH_ON%劳驾，雇佣兵先生，我需要重建一下房子，这样那些 %randomnoblehouse% 的该死手下下次来的时候就有别的东西可以敲了。 顺便说一句，如果你看到一只狗，任何一种狗，请给我送过来。 你的陪伴很好，但我更喜欢那种含蓄的友谊。%SPEECH_OFF%你点头，继续走你的路。 在不远的地方，你确实找到了一只狗，但它现在的状态是不能还给任何人的。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_30.png[/img]一场大火烧毁了一个农场，负责的点火的人骑着马翻过了那边的一座小山。 当他们离开的时候，你冲到房子边上，听到里面的尖叫声。 门被一根木柱子堵住了。 你把它踢到一边，立刻就有火焰冒出来，一个女人从火焰中扑了出来。 她衣衫褴褛，烟雾缭绕，焦炭烧焦，皮肤呈可怕的橙色。 太晚了。 她倒在草地上，你只能走开。\n\n小屋裂开了，然后塌了。 一个男人对你大喊大叫。%SPEECH_ON%就像你看到的，雇佣兵？ 你为什么不继续走呢。%SPEECH_OFF%这是 %randomnoblehouse% 的手下，已经有太多的士兵开始烧杀掠夺了。 你继续前进。 | 小路两旁的树被装满尸体的绳子压得吱吱作响。 每一根树枝都在这个职业中找到了用途－至少有12具尸体在摇摆，大多数尸体头上都挂着袋子。 这棵树的底部刻有 %randomnoblehouse% 的字样。 排版上有一种傲慢的自信。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]几个 %randomnoblehouse% 的士兵站在一棵树旁。 它从树梢到根部都沾满了血。 你可以听到士兵们走过的时候踩踏的声音。%SPEECH_ON%说吧，雇佣兵，你认为死人可以给新的树施肥吗？%SPEECH_OFF%这个人听起来在成为一名刽子手前受过很好的教育，但实际上你根本不知道肥料是什么意思。 你只是点头。他点头作为回应。%SPEECH_ON%是的，我想也是。 好吧，我想再过几年就会有一整片森林了。%SPEECH_OFF%他指着远处，恐怖的轮廓堆在高高的草丛里。 那人突然大笑起来。 你告诉你的人在一些愚蠢的事情发生之前离开。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]你来到这里，发现沿路有几棵树被砍倒了，树桩被锯成了尖刺。 这不是一件艺术品－尸体被钉在那里，恐怖而残忍，脸被适当地扭曲成恐怖的样子。 几个 %randomnoblehouse% 的手下站在附近，似乎对他们的工作很满意。%SPEECH_ON%嘿，雇佣兵。“木头”你能不能让开？%SPEECH_OFF%他笑了笑，转向他的其他手下。%SPEECH_ON%懂吗？%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_95.png[/img]沿着一条小路走，你遇到一堆堆的尸体。 他们脸朝下赤身裸体地躺着。 伤口会在他们的背上留下伤疤。 无论是谁干的，都想给这些可怜的人们带来一些痛苦－而那些更加残忍的生物可能还在附近。 你看到一个 %randomnoblehouse% 的旗帜就在附近的泥地上。 这是在 %companyname% 遇到麻烦之前的一个警告。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_75.png[/img]你正在走的路旁垒着几个土丘。 附近有一些用旧的铲子，你注意到有一只手从一个坟墓中伸出来。 于是你挖开它，你发现一具赤裸的尸体，满嘴的泥土和甲虫。 你不需要挖开其他土丘，就可以知道它们都处于相似的状态。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]你发现一具尸体被钉十字架上，前额上有 %randomnoblehouse%的家徽。 他的手帮助你找到附近的一个城镇，虽然他张开的嘴似乎在喊不要去那里。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_88.png[/img]沿路躺着几排伤兵，他们是 %randomnoblehouse%的一支部队。 你看着一位上了年纪的治疗师，手里拿着钻子和手术刀，走在队列中，照料着那些最吵闹的灵魂。 他走到一个尖叫的特别大声的家伙面前，那家伙抓着一个绿色皱巴巴的瘤子，那是他以前的一条腿。\n\n治疗师把受伤的士兵按倒在地，毫不畏惧地在他的头骨上钻了一个洞。 听到尖叫声，你退缩了。 一种月光般的液体从他的头壳中渗出，骨头碎片沿着泡沫流动，他似乎微笑着，显得很自在，仿佛刚刚的痛苦只是一个梦。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_88.png[/img]一些 %randomnoblehouse%的手下排队去看一个老医生。 你看着这位老人把他的病人这样那样地转着，用拇指戳着他们的肉，闻着他们的衣服、头发、血液。 他的总结被抄写成一卷没有人能看见的卷轴，然后他把人们移到一边。 你问军官这是怎么回事。他解释道。%SPEECH_ON%我们正在看谁还有能力继续战斗。 如果不合适，就放在左边，如果合适，则放在右边。%SPEECH_OFF%慢慢地，你意识到没有一个人被放在左边。 即使是独腿的，瞎眼的或者呼吸困难的，军官咧嘴一笑。%SPEECH_ON%我告诉了老医生去右边的要求，他似乎很满意地遵循了这些要求。%SPEECH_OFF%你问那些要求可能是什么。 军官挑了挑眉毛。%SPEECH_ON%当然，他们一定还在呼吸！ 不过，不要告诉那些人这件事。 对于一支军队来说，放松的幻想是不能有的！%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_71.png[/img]沿着小路可以看到一个人。 他的两条腿都断了，两只手都抓着树干的尖端，好像他不知道自己是怎么落到这种地步的。 他用可怜的眼睛抬头瞥着你。%SPEECH_ON%发生了什么?%SPEECH_OFF%你摇了摇头。 看到%randomnoblehouse%的旗帜，你就知道他是在贵族之间的战争中被袭击的. 受伤的人咳嗽了一声，血液就像一根红绳子一样从他的嘴里喷了出来。 他脸色变得苍白。%SPEECH_ON%哏，我现在感觉好多了。 我想我会再做一次。%SPEECH_OFF%他屏住呼吸，咳嗽着，微笑着，倒下了。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_53.png[/img]你发现有几个男人裸着身体四处爬。 他们拖着内脏，四肢松散地绑在身后，呻吟着，像病房里的垃圾一样活着。 有人抬头瞥了你一眼，他嘴里塞着一个 %randomnoblehouse% 的旗帜。%SPEECH_ON%求求你…%SPEECH_OFF%他断气了。另一个男人抓住你的靴子，但你把他甩开，他也立刻死了。 其余的也停止了移动。 看起来好像他们之前把你当作救世主，但在得到这个坏消息后，他们在失望之中死去了。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_75.png[/img]一个男人满身是血，蹲在小路中间，赤身裸体，除了他正在咬的那把金属刀。 他的手上有血迹，眼睛里带着疯狂。尸体躺在附近。 他们曾经依靠坚硬的盔甲来保护自己，被摧毁了。 那个疯子瞥了他们一眼，然后又看了你一眼。%SPEECH_ON%噢，打得不错。 噢，那是一场精彩的比赛。 噢，我的先生们，这是一场精彩的比赛！%SPEECH_OFF%他跳起来，你拔出剑，但那人转身冲了过去。 你不敢抓住他。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_11.png[/img]你沿着小路来到一棵树前。 有一个人在和一只猫说话，但当你靠近他时，你发现他在可怕的猫科动物的脖子上绑了一根绳子。%SPEECH_ON%咕噜，是的，继续咕噜…一切都会好起来的。 我很抱歉你看到了我所做的事。 我喜欢你的咕噜声…%SPEECH_OFF%你抬高声音。%SPEECH_ON%先生？%SPEECH_OFF%当这个人转过身来的时候，你就会发现他是 %randomnoblehouse% 的手下。猫看到了机会，挣脱了套索，跑了。 那人大叫起来，追了上去。 希望这是你最后一次见到他们。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_17.png[/img] 你走到一个坐在路上的男人面前。 他的大腿上坐着一只狗，尽管那只杂种狗的头软绵绵地垂着，浑身是血。 男人抬头看着你。%SPEECH_ON%你看见我的狗了吗？ 它是条黑狗，有一条白色的尾巴。 你看见我的狗了吗？%SPEECH_OFF%他所描述的小狗现在在他的腿上，但是你不能说太多。 相反，你摇摇头，告诉他一个简单的“没。”他摇摇头作为回应。%SPEECH_ON%%randomnoblehouse% 的手下来过。 毁了一切。他们还带走了我的狗。 喂，你看见我的狗了吗？%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_30.png[/img]你在小路旁边发现了一座燃烧着的小屋。 草地上散落着几具尸体，有些很小。 环顾四周，你没有发现肇事者，尽管 %randomnoblehouse% 的旗帜从附近一棵树的树枝上飘扬而下。 这场战争无人幸免。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_72.png[/img]你发现一个牧羊人站在大屠杀前。 他蜷缩着，双手平放在膝盖上，一根拐杖架在手臂上，就像一只带着阴影的血肉钟。 看到你，他说话很大声，而且口齿伶俐，好像他有什么心事。%SPEECH_ON%士兵们经过。我说不要杀我的羊。 他们说什么羊。 我什么也没说。他们把我推倒在地。 翻山越岭。 找到我的羊了。宰了我的羊。吃了我的羊。 我不应该多嘴的。%SPEECH_OFF%他的拇指扭动着拐杖的两端，但他什么也没说。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]你发现一个人被 %randomnoblehouse% 的旗杆钉在树上。他的眼睛盯着眼前的地面，看着一串脚印，这些脚印似乎已经站了足够长的时间，在泥泞中留下了深深的凹槽。 然后他离开了，他们也离开了。}",

Passing their hands in the shape of aerial rites, these elder healers think it best that these fallen and falling warriors go into the next realm protected from whatever spirits lay beyond. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_21.png[/img]You come across two men laying by the side of a small road. They kick back at the sight of you, one raising a sword.

They nod and tell you to get on.%SPEECH_ON%Keep it moving, strangers.%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_88.png[/img]Both sides of the road are lined with wounded warriors, armored men splayed out, hands draped across their foreheads or clutching the nubs left over from limbs gone missing. In a nearby field there are signs of what battle had brought them to this state of grisly being. This sad lot of men, apparently, 'won' that fight. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_22.png[/img]You find a few noblemen of %randomnoblehouse% peering over a sea of skewered and slain men - apparently you just missed some epic battle. Amongst the dead and dying you watch as swordsman pick through the enemy wounded and finish them off. A few guards head you off.%SPEECH_ON%This ain't your war. Keep on moving or we'll make it yours.%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]You come across a few noblemen standing atop a hill. Guards immediately rush to you, swords drawn.%SPEECH_ON%Do you belong here?%SPEECH_OFF%You look beyond the group to see that scribes are writing down notes. And beyond the scribes lays a scene of incredible destruction, great swathes of dead men from some pointless battle or another.%SPEECH_ON%I asked you a question, stranger.%SPEECH_OFF%You glance back at the guard. The noblemen are also looking down at you now. Shaking your head, you order the %companyname% to get moving before y'all get into another ordeal. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_21.png[/img]You come across a woman cleaning the wounds of a well armored man. He's got some decent equipment on him, and a pair of very dim eyes stare up at you from the faceguard. Drawing out your sword, you tell the woman to step aside so you can finish the job and collect the goods. She shakes her head.%SPEECH_ON%If it's the armor you're interested in you'll have pay better attention.

Go on, take his life and take his gear.%SPEECH_OFF%You shake your head and tell the %companyname% to get going. No more than a few feet further up the road do you see what is seemingly half an army of the noble house's men lingering. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_88.png[/img]A few soldiers hobble past you on the road. Healers are tending to their wounds, and a few women bound after them, sobbing or moaning into their fisted hands. One of the men pauses at the sight of you.%SPEECH_ON%Don't try anything, mercenary. The rest of %randomnoblehouse%'s army marches just yonder.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and let the wounded troop pass. The army never does appear. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_07.png[/img]You come across a man being hounded by scoundrels. Seeing you, the thieves quickly take the fallen man's boots, pants, and bits of armor and one lopes off with a sword, the blade leveled across raised arms like some heretical thaumaturge carrying a relic of impossible yet brittle power.\n\n When you get to the wounded soldier he raises his hands to the sky, your silhouette no doubt blurred between his splayed fingers. He says something which you do not hear and then he is dead. There is nothing else to take from him. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]A wounded man is sitting up against a signpost. He nods at you as you near.%SPEECH_ON%Mercenaries?%SPEECH_OFF%As you get closer, you see the sigil of %randomnoblehouse% stitched across an unfurled and trampled banner. You don't answer his question, instead looking around for an ambush or soldiers from his house. There are none. And the man himself has been stripped to his skivvies. He coughs and shifts as though to tilt the pain from one end of his body to the other.%SPEECH_ON%Yeah, I suppose you don't have to answer. I'll be dead soon anyhow. I'd feel a lot better if you didn't stick around to watch.%SPEECH_OFF%A pleading eye meets yours.

He's got the banner of %randomnoblehouse% trailing behind him, a messied and shredded coattail if there ever was one. You watch as he nestls against the bosom of the animal and begins to suck on its teat. He tries each grayed nub in turn, though not a drop of milk is to be had for Death is the driest of counties. Sighing, he flops over and finally sees you.%SPEECH_ON%Ah hell, don't look at me like that.%SPEECH_OFF%You offer water and he takes a sip.%SPEECH_ON%Dreadful. I guess I won't miss this place much.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod and think to speak, but you notice the man is staring straight ahead, his arms flat at his sides, and a couple of flies got news of his passing before you did. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]You come across a naked man clothed only in the torn banner of %randomnoblehouse%. A large black bird is eating his feet. He stares at it, then at you, explaining himself in embarrassment.%SPEECH_ON%It asked if it could have a bite.%SPEECH_OFF%You raise an eyebrow.%SPEECH_ON%And you said yes?%SPEECH_OFF%The man shrugs.%SPEECH_ON%I don't remember what I said.%SPEECH_OFF%With a crack, the beak rips off a toe.

A dead dog is at the base of the tree and another headless mutt swings by its feet.

You watch as the animal buckles and goes headfirst into a ditch where it rolls and pitches, stands, stumbles, and finally goes still.\n\n Turning down the road, you come to find a stable consumed by fires and a nearby hovel burnt to cinders. A few laymen are dead in the grass and their dogs, goats, and sheep and all else is there with them. You're not sure which side of the realm's war is responsible for this, but you've no desire to stick around and find out. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_54.png[/img]You come upon a hovel with fires blazing forth from its windows. There's a body in the grass, skinned and, by the looks on its face, it was a slow treatment.\n\n Suddenly, the door to the home kicks open and a man on fire stumbles out. He takes one look at you and your men, screams, and simply goes back inside. The roof collapses and whatever terror was born here finally dies. You tell the %companyname% to get moving lest someone, or some large army, come to think it was you who did this. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_22.png[/img]You come across a soldier standing with his hands tented over the end of a spiked spear.

You fly the most common banner of all, soldier. Would you like a mushroom?%SPEECH_OFF%He holds one up. It is mushed and muddied. You decline and order the men to get to marching again. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_37.png[/img]You come across a few men flying the %randomnoblehouse% banner. They're yanking dogs at the ends of their leashes, and the dogs are being separated from corpses, leashes of flesh pulled between their teeth and the bodies. Spotting you, one of the soldiers tells you off.%SPEECH_ON%We ain't got money for your services, mercenary, but I'll put an axe in that dumb face of yours if you don't move on.%SPEECH_OFF%There are far, far too many soldiers around to respond to that so you just nod and move on. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_36.png[/img]You spot a shepherd herding goats along a hillside. He spots you and waves.%SPEECH_ON%This is not the safest place for folks like me.%SPEECH_OFF%He kicks one of the goats along.

He spits and looks around.%SPEECH_ON%Hope they didn't take off with my dog.%SPEECH_OFF%The man lets out a sharp whistle, pauses, then nods grimly.%SPEECH_ON%Suppose they did.%SPEECH_OFF%He goes over his charcoaled hovel and begins to kick the wooden frames away.%SPEECH_ON%Excuse me, sir mercenary, I need to rebuild so that those damned %randomnoblehouse% grunts have something else to knock over the next time they come around.

Not far off you do find a dog, but it is in no state to be returned to anyone. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_30.png[/img]A fire consumes a farmstead, and the pyros responsible are just riding over a hill yonder. When they leave, you rush to the home and come to hear screams inside. The door has been jammed with shut with a wooden post. You kick it aside and instantly fires burst forth and a woman scatters out from the flames. She is in tatters, smoky and charcoaled and ghastly orange. It is too late. She falls into the grass and you can only step away.\n\n The hovel cracks and then collapses. A man barks out to you.%SPEECH_ON%Like what you see, mercenary? Why don't you go on and get going.%SPEECH_OFF%It's the bannermen of %randomnoblehouse% and there are far too many soldiers to start any sort of battle. You get on going. | The trees that line the path are creaking with ropes weighted with corpses. Every branch has found a use in this vocation - you count at least a dozen bodies swinging, most with sacks over their heads. The house words of %randomnoblehouse% have been carved into the base of the tree. There's a sort of haughty confidence in the typography. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]A few soldiers of %randomnoblehouse% stand beside a tree. It is caked with blood from treetop to its roots. You can hear the squash of the soldiers' boots as they step through it.%SPEECH_ON%Say, mercenary, do you think the dead could fertilize new trees?%SPEECH_OFF%The man sounds awfully educated to be a murderous soldier, but really you have no idea what fertilize means. You simply nod. He nods in return.%SPEECH_ON%Yeah, I figured as much. Well, I suppose in a couple years there's gonna be a whole forest thataway.%SPEECH_OFF%He points toward some distance, silhouettes of horror stacked high in the grass. The man bursts into laughter. You tell your men to get going before something stupid goes down. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]You come to find a few trees along the path have been cut down and their stumps sawed into spikes. This wasn't an artistic matter - bodies have been spiked there, grisly and cruel, faces appropriately contorted to the horrors that met them in the end. A few bannermen of %randomnoblehouse% stand nearby, seemingly happy with their work.%SPEECH_ON%Hey, mercenary. 'Wood' you please kindly move along?%SPEECH_OFF%He laughs and turns to the rest of his men.%SPEECH_ON%Get it?%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_95.png[/img]Moving along a path, you come across a bodies all clumped together. They're lying face down and naked. Wounds pepper their backs, superficial until they weren't. Whoever did this wanted to exact some amount of pain on these poor folks - and those creatures of crueler stock might still be around. You spot a banner of %randomnoblehouse% laying in the mud just nearby. That's enough to spur the %companyname% along before it can find trouble. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_75.png[/img]A few mounds of earth mottle the sides of the path you are on. Some mudworn shovels are nearby, and you can't help but notice that a hand is sticking forth from one of the graves. Uncovering it, you find a naked corpse, mouth full of dirt and beetles. You need not uncover the rest to know they're in a similar state. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]You come to find a body crucified to a signpost with %randomnoblehouse%'s sigil carved into his forehead. His hands help aide you in finding a nearby town, though his open mouth seems to shout to not go there. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_88.png[/img]Along the road lay rows of wounded men from one of %randomnoblehouse%'s armies. You watch as an elderly healer walks the lines, drill and scalpel in hand, tending to those souls who are loudest. He sets himself upon a particularly shrill fellow who is clutching a green and puckered nub where one of his legs used to be.\n\n The healer holds the wounded soldier down and with no trepidation in his trephination he begins to bore a hole into the man's skull. You wince at the screams. A moonly fluid seeps from the brainpan, chips of bone coursing along the froth, and as the sickly blue ruin pours over the man's face he appears to smile and be at ease, as though peace came by way of an augered and fevered dream. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_88.png[/img]A few of %randomnoblehouse%'s bannermen line up to see an elderly healer. You watch as the old man turns his patients this way and that, pressing his thumbs into their flesh, smelling their clothes, their hair, their blood. His summations are scribed into a scroll no one can see, and then he moves the men off to a side. You ask a lieutenant what is going on. He explains.%SPEECH_ON%We are seeing who is still fit to fight. If you are not fit, you go to the left, if you are fit, you go to the right.%SPEECH_OFF%Slowly, you realize not a single man is put to the left. Not even the one-legged or blind or wheezing. The lieutenant grins.%SPEECH_ON%I told the healer my requirements for going to the right and he seems to be following them satisfactorily.%SPEECH_OFF%You ask what those requirements might be. The lieutenant raises an eyebrow.%SPEECH_ON%Why, they must be breathing, of course! Don't tell the men that, though. Illusions of relaxation is nothing but decay to an army!%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_71.png[/img]A man is found along a path. He's missing both his legs, the nubs of their trunks in each hand as though he had no idea how he'd come to this state. With pitiful eyes, he glances up at you.%SPEECH_ON%What happened?%SPEECH_OFF%You shake your head. Seeing the banner of %randomnoblehouse%, though, you gather that he was attacked in the midst of the war amongst the nobles. The wounded man coughs and a rope of red spurts from one of the stumps. His face goes pale.%SPEECH_ON%Huh, I feel much better now. I think I'll do that again.%SPEECH_OFF%He gathers his breath to cough, smiles, and falls over. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_53.png[/img]You find a few men crawling about naked. They're dragging innards and loosely tethered limbs behind them, moaning and groaning like the refuse of a medical ward come alive. One glances up at you, the banner of %randomnoblehouse% stuffed into his mouth.%SPEECH_ON%Please...%SPEECH_OFF%He collapses. Another man grabs onto your boot, but you shake him off and he, too, dies in the moment. The rest stop moving one by one in turn. It appears as though they sought you as a savior and, upon getting the bad news, they died in disappointed union. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_75.png[/img]A man's slathered in blood, setting squat in the middle of a path, naked save for the metal knife he's biting down on. He's got gore in his hands, and mad lust in his eyes. Bodies lay nearby. Destroyed, demolished in shells of armor that they once depended upon for protection. The insane man glances at them, then at you.%SPEECH_ON%Oh, it was good fight. Oh, it was a good fight. Oh, my sirs, it was a good fight!%SPEECH_OFF%He jumps to his feet and you draw your sword, but the man turns and sprints away. You dare not catch him or his curse. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_11.png[/img]You come to a tree along the path. There's a man talking to a cat, but as you get closer you realize he's tied a rope around the fearful feline's neck.%SPEECH_ON%Purr, yes, keep purring... all will be well. I'm sorry you saw the things I did. I love your purring...%SPEECH_OFF%You raise your voice.%SPEECH_ON%Sir?%SPEECH_OFF%The second the man turns around you see that he is a bannerman of %randomnoblehouse%. Seeing its chance, the cat slips its noose and scatters. The man cries out and gives chase. Hopefully, that is the last you see of them both. |[img]gfx/ui/events/event_17.png[/img] You come to a man sitting in the road. He's got a dog nestled in his lap, though the mutt's head is hanging limp and bloodied. The man looks up at you.%SPEECH_ON%Have you seen my dog? It's black, matted, has a white tail. Have you seen my dog?%SPEECH_OFF%The pup he's describing is currently in his lap, but you do not say as much. Instead, you shake your head and tell the man a simple 'no.' He shakes his head in return.%SPEECH_ON%The bannermen of %randomnoblehouse% came by. Destroyed everything. And they took my dog. Say, have you seen my dog?%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_30.png[/img]You find a burning cottage beside the path. A few dead bodies are scattered about the grass, some of them quite small. Looking around, you do not find the perpetrators, though the banner of %randomnoblehouse% is flying from the branches of a nearby tree. The war is sparing no one. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_72.png[/img]You come to find a shepherd standing before a massacre. He's crouched, hands balanced over his knees, a cane balanced over his arms, like some fleshen clock with shadows for time. Seeing you, he speaks up and he's rather articulate, as though he's getting something long on his mind.%SPEECH_ON%Soldiers came by. I said don't kill my sheep. They said what sheep. I said nothing. They pushed me down. Went over the hill. Found my sheep. Slaughtered my sheep. Ate my sheep. I should have kept my mouth shut.%SPEECH_OFF%His thumbs twist the ends of his walking staff, but he says nothing more. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_02.png[/img]You find a man impaled to a tree by the banner pole of his house, %randomnoblehouse%. His eyes stare at the ground before him, at a litter of footprints that seemed to have been standing around long enough to leave deep grooves in the mud. And then he departed and so did they.}\""
