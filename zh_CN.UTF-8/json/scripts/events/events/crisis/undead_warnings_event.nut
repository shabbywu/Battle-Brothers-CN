    "original": "{[img]gfx/ui/events/event_17.png[/img]While stopping for a brief respite, a stranger approaches the camp. He's got a wooden stake for a leg, though he wobbles on it with practiced efficiency. Hobbling to you, he tips a cap of broomstraw.%SPEECH_ON%I suppose you fellas are here for the happenings?%SPEECH_OFF%You glance at %randombrother% then back to the man. He shrugs.%SPEECH_ON%Ah, mayhaps ye don't know. I don't really know, either, but there be a lot of grisly stories about what is happening all around these parts. The way I hear it, the dead are walking the earth, but that's hogwash. I think it's just a bunch of brigands with new tricks up their sleeves. Anyway, be seeing you. Stay safe and all that malarkey.%SPEECH_OFF%The man laughs as he stilts away. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_97.png[/img]A child is found beside the path with a skull laid between their legs. Its upside down with insects battling one another in the bowl of the brainpan. The kid briefly looks up.%SPEECH_ON%Hi there.%SPEECH_OFF%You ask where his parents are. He picks up a dead bug from the skull, looks at it, then tosses it over his shoulder. He puts another wriggling gladiator into the grey arena then stares at you.%SPEECH_ON%Parents? Why they ain't been around for awhile. Father went to his parents, and mother to hers. And they both was ate'n.%SPEECH_OFF%You raise an eyebrow and ask for him to repeat what he just said, but the kid ignores you, absentmindedly cheering into the hollow head as his bugs do battle. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_18.png[/img]You come to a man standing in the path. He's got a shovel yoked over both shoulders, his hands crucifixed across each side, and he's dripping with mud. He glances up, this golem of earth, and asks where you're going. Before you answer, he interrupts.%SPEECH_ON%Don't go that way. Don't go no way. They're everywhere. I was digging, you see? Digging to get to them first. But they know. They where we are. Don't go nowhere, because they're everywhere. Don't go nowhere, because they're everywhere, and they know... they know, don't you see?%SPEECH_OFF%He presses his head forward, his cringing face crooning forth from his dripping arms like some muddied bat come to feast on your dreams. You ease past the man. %randombrother% looks him up and down, shrugs, and follows you. The %companyname% has no time for such madmen. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_71.png[/img]While on the road, you come to a small, empty hut. %randombrother% snoops around inside, you beside him, the both of you with blades out. He shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%Ain't shit here.%SPEECH_OFF%He looks up and points.%SPEECH_ON%Except there.%SPEECH_OFF%You look up and see that the ceiling is covered in blood. Not just covered... written over. Unfortunately, the script is hard to read as the crimson words are muddied by mold and termitic erasure.\n\n You mouth the visible letters: DO---GO---IDE---WE---LL---R---OOMED.\n\n Clearly the work of a madman. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_46.png[/img]There's a copse in the path, a little set of trees that stand tall in an otherwise flat clearing. You take some respite there, for little trees such as these borrow the silence and sereneness from their larger forest cousins. Except not this one. This one you find a dead child in the bushes.\n\n %randombrother% comes up and covers his mouth.%SPEECH_ON%By the might of the old gods, who would do such a thing?%SPEECH_OFF%You take a knee. There are tracks all over the area. It appears the kid was chased and ended up running into the bushes. Probably got tied up there, stuck. More footsteps followed. Way more. They stayed for a while, then left with bloody footprints. The kid, what is left of him, is covered in bite marks. You turn to the mercenary and answer.%SPEECH_ON%I think it's a matter of what, not who. But they're gone. Somewhere yonder, a few days ahead I'd wager, but...%SPEECH_OFF%You count the footsteps, but they prove too many.%SPEECH_ON%I think whatever did this... we'll be seeing it soon.%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_76.png[/img]You come to a man standing with a white banner, an unthreaded sigil in the middle, its frayed remains billowing in the wind. He nods.%SPEECH_ON%Good to see some flesh.%SPEECH_OFF%Well, that was not what you were expecting as his first words. Naturally, you inquire as to what he means. He looks incredulous.%SPEECH_ON%You know, flesh. As opposed to bones. I've seen too many of those lately so, yeah, it's nice seeing some flesh.%SPEECH_OFF%You inquire further, asking what kind of bones this man has been seeing. He slims his eyes as if guarding them against the winds of a past he'd prefer to forget.%SPEECH_ON%The walkin' kind. Bones that'll walk through your door in the middle of the night. Bones that kill everything in front of them. Bones that want to see more bones just like them. Them sort of bones, got it?%SPEECH_OFF%His face lightens up, the eyes widening. He pivots toward you and suddenly leans forward.%SPEECH_ON%You wouldn't happen to be made of bones, would you?%SPEECH_OFF%Sensing a threat in the words, %randombrother% jumps in, positioning to kill the man before he can act. You settle everyone down. The stranger appears at ease, but you order the %companyname% to walk around him with care. He doesn't move. He simply stands as the last tendrils of his banner unravel into the wind. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_40.png[/img]There's a man in the path. He's on his hands and knees with scrolls littered all around. He bounds from one to the other like a dog would a scattering of treats. He shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%No no no, no! Where is it? Ah! Stranger! I mean, uh, sellsword, er, friend! Friend?%SPEECH_OFF%You ask what the man is doing. His hands are shaking as he answers.%SPEECH_ON%I, uh, have a theory. About who we are, er, were. In the past. Way before today, understand? Of course you do.%SPEECH_OFF%You watch as the man gathers his notes, stuffing them into a satchel. He continues.%SPEECH_ON%I think our past is coming to haunt us again, my dear sir sellsword friend, and when they come, they will kill us all. Because they want it back. They want it ALL back.%SPEECH_OFF%The man throws the satchel over his shoulder and nods.%SPEECH_ON%Now I have others to inform. Thanks for listening and, uh, farewell.%SPEECH_OFF%Well... bye. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_75.png[/img]While marching, something crunches awkwardly underfoot. You stop and take a knee to see. Swiping away some dirt, you find splintered shards of pottery. They appear to be, or used to be, part of a piece of art. You piece them together until a picture comes into view. %randombrother% stands behind you and asks.%SPEECH_ON%So, what is that?%SPEECH_OFF%You trace a finger along the artwork. Depicted are armored soldiers with spears and behind them more men stand with polearms, their formation as thick as the forests from which they made their weapons. They appear to be marching forward one step at a time, cutting down all the enemies in their path with brutal efficiency.\n\n You try and pick the shards up. A low hum emits from the clay and each piece suddenly turns to powder, the remains streaming between your fingers. Something that old... that peculiar... what is it doing out here in the middle of nowhere? | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_11.png[/img]An odd figure shuffles across the path. You draw your sword and follow, eventually creeping behind a small girl holding an infant. The child wheels around to look at you, the bundled babe in her arms comfortably asleep. You ask what they are doing way out here. The girl shrugs.%SPEECH_ON%Running from the bads.%SPEECH_OFF%You cautiously glance around before asking what she means. She responds as if the answer to the question is tiresomely obvious.%SPEECH_ON%The bads. We buried them good, but they came up bad. Now they're killing everyone. So I run. I run from the bads.%SPEECH_OFF%She peers down at the infant and then out toward the land.%SPEECH_ON%Excuse me, sir. My grandfather lives yonder. He is expecting me and me alone.%SPEECH_OFF%You grab her shoulder and ask where her parents are. She shrugs off your hand.%SPEECH_ON%They're with the bads. Now excuse me, I must get going.%SPEECH_OFF%Clutching the baby, the girl quickly ducks into some brush. Such a little thing, she hardly makes a noise thereafter, and you've little doubt that her safe silence will see her to her destination. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_91.png[/img]You come to an old woman in the road. She waves you down with one hand while the other clutches her neck. As you get closer, you see that her white hairs are waning, leaving a dome of her skull revealed, and her garish nose wheeze with every breath. Age has been most unkind in all resorts. Her words are expectedly labored.%SPEECH_ON%Have you seen an old man on the roads?%SPEECH_OFF%Shaking your head, you ask what happened to her. She reveals her neck from which there are two holes. A bit of pus flows from each until she covers back up.%SPEECH_ON%My husband and I were attacked last night. I don't know where he is. I think they took him. They tried to take me, but the man attacking me must've smelled something foul because he got but a small taste before running off. Maybe it was my cooking. I always add too much garlic. My husband, he skipped dinner that night, that grouchy fool.%SPEECH_OFF%You put up a hand, slowing her down. You tell her to carefully explain who or what actually attacked. She nods and responds.%SPEECH_ON%Right, it was...%SPEECH_OFF%She pauses and her eyes seem to change attention, as if she blinked without closing a single eyelid. She glances back at you and smiles.%SPEECH_ON%Hello, have you seen an old man on the roads? He's my husband. We were attacked last night and I think they took him...%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_16.png[/img]You come to a tiny little town by the side of the path. An insular place where no doubt everyone knows everyone. Outside one of the hovels, there's the charred remains of a bonfire. The sickly black shape of a person is in the ruins. One of the townspeople comes over, tipping their strawhat up while tenting their hands on a pitchfork. He speaks rather cheerily.%SPEECH_ON%That right there is taking care of a problem once and for all.%SPEECH_OFF%Curious, you ask what happened. The man answers earnestly, as if happy to relive the moments.%SPEECH_ON%Well, that there deadened thing you see used to be %randomname%. The man lived yonder from here, in the backend parts of this backend town. He used to do readings, like you know, from bones and blood or some sorry sortition. Fool kept going on and on about how the dead were going to come back and kill us all. We don't take kindly to shamanistic reckonings so we gave him the straight-and-narrow side of what is right and lawful.%SPEECH_OFF%The man spits and nods.%SPEECH_ON%And that was that.%SPEECH_OFF%Almost as if on cue, the bonfire crumbles and the boneshards scatter. A plume of ash and smoke are all that remain. | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_57.png[/img]You come across a graveyard off to the side of the path. The place is a mess. The plots are uncovered and the gravestones overturned and scattered. It is as if a horde of graverobbers descended upon the place and picked it clean. Except... they took the bodies too? %randombrother% stands at your side and shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%Cannibals?%SPEECH_OFF%This was not the work of cannibals, but you nod for that answer is more calming then what might be the truth: whatever was buried here got up and left on their own two feet... | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_46.png[/img]While marching, you come across an abandoned camp. %randombrother% walks through it and kick over a pan slick with oil. Rotten bacon and eggs spill into the grass. He turns his attention to some bags but comes up empty.\n\n The ground reveals fresh footprints. A clutter of them circle around what was the fire, but there is no dance in their evidence, instead it seems they were frantically rushing to and fro. Marching toward them is a horde of prints, shuffling and dragging their feet with no order. And then, as these two storied prints meet, only the latter continues forward.\n\n %randombrother% pulls back a bush to reveal a dead body. There's a shovel firmly slotted into its skull. The skin of it makes you think the person had been dead for at least two or three weeks - so the footprints are far too fresh for this body to have created them. You've no idea what happened here, but it could not have been good. Going forward, the men of %companyname% should stay sharp for some evil walks these lands.}",
    "translation": "{[img]gfx/ui/events/event_17.png[/img]在短暂休息时，一个陌生人走近营地。 他找了根木桩代替腿，然而他能熟练地摇摇晃晃的走。 他一瘸一拐地走到你跟前，手里拿着一顶扫帚草帽。%SPEECH_ON%我猜你们是来看热闹的吧？%SPEECH_OFF%你看了眼 %randombrother% 然后看向那个人。他耸耸肩。%SPEECH_ON%唉，也许你不知道。 我也不很清楚，但是我知道关于这附近正在上演的事的一些消息。 我听到的说法是，死人们在地面上走来走去，但那不是狗屁吗。 我认为那不过是一群突发奇想的强盗罢了。 不管怎样，再见。 注意安全，刚说的都是胡扯哈哈。%SPEECH_OFF%那个人笑着蹦跳离开了。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_97.png[/img]在小路旁边发现了一个孩子，两腿间夹着一个头骨。 昆虫在那个倒置的头骨里里互相争斗。 孩子抬头简单看了你一眼。%SPEECH_ON%你好啊。%SPEECH_OFF%你问他的父母在哪里。 他从头盖骨里捡起一只死虫子，看了看，然后把它扔到身后。 捡起另一个扭来扭去的角斗士，把它放进灰色的竞技场，然后看着你。%SPEECH_ON%父母？为什么他们好一段时间都没出现了。 父亲去找他的父母，母亲去找她的父母。 所以他俩都不在。%SPEECH_OFF%你挑了挑眉毛，让他再说一遍，但他没理你，心不在焉地对着空洞脑袋里正进行的战斗欢呼。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_18.png[/img]你走到一个站在路上的人面前。 把铁锹横跨搭在两个肩膀上，双手放在两端，身上还滴着泥水。 这个大地魔像一样的人，抬头瞥向你，问你要去哪里。 你还没回答，他就又打断了。%SPEECH_ON%不要走那条路。 那条路走不通。 他们到处都是。我正在挖，你看到了吗？ 先挖到他们。 但他们知道。他们知道我们在哪儿。 哪也别去，因为他们无处不在。 哪也别去，因为他们无处不在，他们知道…他们知道，你没看见吗？%SPEECH_OFF%他把头伸向前，畏缩的脸从他的滴着泥水的胳膊伸出来低低地唱着，像沾泥的蝙蝠要来吃你的梦。 你轻易地越过了那个人。%randombrother% 上下打量着他，耸耸肩，然后跟上了你。 %companyname% 可没时间耗在疯子身上。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_71.png[/img]在路上，你来到一个小而空的小屋。%randombrother% 在里面看了看，你在他旁边，都抽出了利刃。他摇了摇头。%SPEECH_ON%他妈的不在这儿。%SPEECH_OFF%他抬起头指了指。%SPEECH_ON%除了那儿。%SPEECH_OFF%你抬头看见天花板上全是血。 不是溅到上面…而人为写满了。 不幸的是，字迹很难读，因为深红色的字被霉菌覆盖和白蚁啮食弄得模糊不清。\n\n 你含糊地读出几个能看清的字：做－走－主意－我们－来－干－毁灭。\n\n 显然是一个疯子的杰作。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_46.png[/img]小路上有一片小树林，一小片树林高高耸立在原本平坦的空地上。 你在那里稍作休息，因为像这样的小树能从它们在森林里的亲戚那里偷得宁静和安详。 可是这个要除外。 在这个灌木丛中你发现一个死去的孩子。\n\n %randombrother% 捂着嘴走上前。%SPEECH_ON%以旧神的名义，谁会干这种事？%SPEECH_OFF%你单膝跪地。 地上有很多足迹。 似乎是这个小孩被什么东西追赶，最终跑进了这个小灌木丛里。 可能是被什么勾住了，困在这里。 更多足迹追寻过来。还有更多。 然后留下带血的足迹离开。 这个小孩，剩下的躯体，被咬痕所覆盖。 你转向佣兵们，回答到。%SPEECH_ON%我认为这是什么东西，而不是谁干了这种事。 但是他们已经离开了。我敢打赌，就在我们前方两三天路程的地方，但是…%SPEECH_OFF%你数了数脚印，但是太多数不过来。%SPEECH_ON%我想不管那是啥…我们很快就能见到他了。%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_76.png[/img]你走进一个举着白色旗帜站在那的男人，旗帜中间是一个抽线的印章，饱经磨损的残留仍在风中飘扬。他点头。%SPEECH_ON%能看到鲜活的肉真是太好了。%SPEECH_OFF%好吧，这样的开场白是你没预料到的。 很自然的，你问他什么意思。他看起来有点怀疑。%SPEECH_ON%鲜活的肉。而不是白骨。 我最近看到太多这种东西了，所以，是的，看到鲜活的肉真不错。%SPEECH_OFF%你继续问，这人看见的是什么骨头。 他眯起眼睛，好像是要阻挡他更愿意忘记的追来的吹自过去的风。%SPEECH_ON%能走的东西。半夜闯进门的骨头。 杀死所有在他们面前的东西的骨头。 想看到更多和他们一样的骨头。 真的就是那种，那种骨头，你懂了吗？%SPEECH_OFF%他睁大眼睛，的脸色亮了起来。 他突然转身，向你倾了点。%SPEECH_ON%你应该不会碰巧是骨头做的吧，嗯？%SPEECH_OFF%觉察到言语中的威胁，%randombrother% 跳到你前面，做出在那名男子行动之前就结果他的姿态。 你让所有人都冷静一下。 陌生人显得很惬意，但是你让 %companyname% 小心围住他。 他根本没动，只是简单站在那里，任旗帜的最后一丝线缕飘入风中。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_40.png[/img]在路上有一个人。 他伏在地上，手边到处都是散落的卷轴。 他不停从一个卷轴跳到另一个，就像狗把东西弄满地东西那样玩一样。 He shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%不，不，不，不！ 我弄哪去了？啊！陌生人！ 我是说，呃，佣兵，呃，朋友！朋友？%SPEECH_OFF%你问这个人在做什么。 他手抖着回答道。%SPEECH_ON%我，呃，有个想法。 关于我们是谁，呃，曾经是。在过去。 Way before today, understand? 你当然看得到。%SPEECH_OFF%你看着那个人整理他的笔记，把它们塞进一个袋子里。他继续道。%SPEECH_ON%我想我们的过去又开始困扰我们了，亲爱的佣兵朋友先生，当他们来的时候，他们会把我们所有人都杀了。 因为他们想取回。 他们想要全部收回。%SPEECH_OFF%那人把袋子扔在肩上，点了点头。%SPEECH_ON%现在我还要去通知别人。 谢谢你听了这么会儿，呃，那么再见。%SPEECH_OFF%好吧…再见。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_75.png[/img]行军时，有什么东西在脚下发出了怪异的嘎吱嘎吱声。 你停下来，单膝着地。 擦去一些泥土，发现裂开的陶器的碎块。 它们好像是，或者曾经是，一件艺术品的一部分。 你把它们拼在一起，一个图画出现在你面前。%randombrother% 站在你后面问。%SPEECH_ON%那是啥？%SPEECH_OFF%你用一根指头拂过工艺品。 上面刻画着全副武装的手持矛的士兵，身后有更多使用长柄兵器的士兵，他们的阵型和森林一样厚密，他们的武器是由森林制作的。 他们看起来一步一步向前行进，以残忍的效率消灭所有挡住道路的敌人。\n\n 你试着把碎片捡起来。 从粘土里发出一种低沉的嗡嗡声，然后每个碎块都突然变成了粉末，从你指缝里流走。 这么古老…奇特…的东西。为什么在这个地方呢？ | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_11.png[/img]一个奇怪的人影拖着脚穿过小路。 你拔出剑，跟在后面，最后慢慢跟到了一个抱着婴儿的小女孩身后。 女孩转过身来看了看你，襁褓里的婴儿正舒舒服服地在她的怀里睡着。 你问他们在外面干什么。这个女孩耸耸肩。%SPEECH_ON%逃离邪恶的东西。%SPEECH_OFF%在问她什么意思之前，你仔细地环顾四周。 她回答的时候好像问题的答案太明显了。%SPEECH_ON%坏蛋。我们把它们埋得很好，但它们却坏了。 现在他们要杀了所有人。 所以我跑了。我逃避那些坏蛋。%SPEECH_OFF%她低头看着婴儿，然后朝外面的地面望去。%SPEECH_ON%劳驾，先生。我的祖父住在那边。 他在等我，就等我一个人。%SPEECH_OFF%你抓住她的肩膀，问她父母在哪里。 她甩开你的手。%SPEECH_ON%他们和坏人在一起。 对不起，我必须得动身了。%SPEECH_OFF%女孩抱着孩子，迅速没入灌木丛中。 她还这么小，之后几乎没发出任何声音，你几乎不怀疑，她的轻巧会让她安全到达目的地。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_91.png[/img]你在路上遇到一位老太太。 她一只手捂着脖子，另一只手向你挥手示意。 当你走近时，你发现她的白头发日趋势微，露出了脑门的一部分，她那滑稽的鼻子随着每一次呼吸都呼哧呼哧地响。 年龄在任何方面都很不友好。 可以预见她说话很吃力。%SPEECH_ON%你在路上看到一个老头吗？%SPEECH_OFF%你摇着头，问她发生了什么事。 她露出有两个洞的脖子。 两个洞都在流脓，直到她重新用手捂住。%SPEECH_ON%我和我丈夫昨晚被袭击了。 我不知道他在哪里。 我想他们带走了他。 他们想带走我，但那个袭击我的人一定是闻到了什么难闻的东西，因为他只尝了一小口就逃跑了。 也许是我做的饭。 我总是放太多的大蒜。 我丈夫那天晚上没吃饭，那个爱发牢骚的笨蛋。%SPEECH_OFF%你举起一只手，让她慢下来。 你要求她仔细解释到底是谁或什么东西攻击了她。 她点头回应。%SPEECH_ON%好吧，那是…%SPEECH_OFF%她停顿了一下，她的目光似乎突然改变了聚焦，就好像根本没有动过眼皮地眨眼了一样。 她回头瞥了你一眼，笑了。%SPEECH_ON%你好，你在路上看到一个老头了吗？ 那是我的丈夫。我们昨晚被袭击了，我想他们把他带走了…%SPEECH_OFF% | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_16.png[/img]你来到了路边的一个小镇。 一个与世隔绝的地方，毫无疑问，这里的人们互相都认识。 在一间小屋外，有一堆烧焦的篝火残留物。 一个黢黑的病恹恹的人躺在废墟里。 一个镇民过来了，双手搭在干草叉上，掀开草帽。 他说话相当愉快。%SPEECH_ON%那儿正打算彻底的解决问题。%SPEECH_OFF%出于好奇，你问发生了什么事。 那人认真地回答，仿佛很高兴能重温那一刻。%SPEECH_ON%嗯，你看到的死掉的的东西曾经是 %randomname%。那个人就住在离这儿不远的地方，在这个后端城市的后端。 他过去经常阅读，就像你知道的那样，从骨头和血液中，或者一些令人感到不好的东西。 傻瓜不停地说着死人会怎样回来把我们都杀了。 我们无法对这种萨满式的审判保持仁慈，所以我们让他见识了正确又合法行为直接并且没度量的一面。%SPEECH_OFF%那个男人啐了一口，点头。%SPEECH_ON%就这样。%SPEECH_OFF%好像回应一样，篝火的残留物崩塌了，骨头碎片也四散。 只剩下一团灰烬和飘升的烟。 | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_57.png[/img]你在小路的一旁看到一片墓地。 这地方一片狼藉。 罐子被打开，墓碑被推翻散落一地。 就好像一群盗墓贼降临到这个地方，把它搜刮得干干净净。 除了…他们连尸体也带走了？%randombrother% 站在你旁边摇了摇头。%SPEECH_ON%食人族？%SPEECH_OFF%这不是食人族干的事，但你点头表示同意，因为这个答案相比可能的真相更能让人心安：埋在这里的东西都爬了起来，用自己的双腿离开了… | [img]gfx/ui/events/event_46.png[/img]行军时，你遇到一个废弃的营地。%randombrother% 走过去，踢翻一个还有油的平底锅。 腐烂的培根和鸡蛋洒到草地上。 他把注意转到几个包上，但那是空的。\n\n 地面上露出了了新鲜的脚印。 在曾经是火的地方散乱围成一个圆，没有迹象表明跳过舞，相反，他们似乎在发疯似地跑来跑去。 有一大群脚印朝他们奔来，拖着脚没有秩序地行进。 在这之后，这两拨痕迹相遇，只留下了后者继续推进。\n\n %randombrother% 拉过一撮灌木丛，露出一具尸体。 有一把铁锹牢牢地插在它的脑袋里。 它的皮肤会让你觉得这个人已经死了至少两三个星期了－所以这些脚印对这个尸体来说太新鲜了，不可能是它造成的。 你不知道这里曾发生了什么，但绝不可能是什么好事。 继续行进时，%companyname% 的小伙子们应该保持警惕，因为有什么邪恶的东西正在这篇大陆大行其道。}",
