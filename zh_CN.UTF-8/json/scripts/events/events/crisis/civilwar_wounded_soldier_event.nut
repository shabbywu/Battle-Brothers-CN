He cries out, but it is brief, ending on the sharp twang of your blade running his tongue through the back of his head. Gargling, he batters the metal of the killing blow before settling down. Shivering eyes look up at you as a cold death takes him. Retrieving your sword, you look over your shoulder and tell the men to take everything he had on him. You wipe your blade on the cloth of the dead man's banner. | The man sees in the intent in your eyes and quickly raises his voice, but you dash forward, unsheathing your blade and running it through his brainpan in one swift motion. He dies, and you feel a pang in your side. Not a moral one, but an older, more real pain. %randombrother% steadies you with a hand on your shoulder.%SPEECH_ON%Easy, sir, you're not as limber as you once were.%SPEECH_OFF%Nodding, you clean your blade and tell the men to loot what they can. | The soldier leans back.%SPEECH_ON%Ah, I see.%SPEECH_OFF%He lifts his neck.%SPEECH_ON%You got me. I'll go out like a man should.%SPEECH_OFF%With a quick cut, he puts his head back down, a bubbling crimson froth running down his chest. Your men loot what they can. | You take out your dagger.

He stares up at you.%SPEECH_ON%Wait...%SPEECH_OFF%That is his last word. He tries to utter something else, but the massive gash you've opened across his throat only produces horrid gargling. You order %randombrother% to loot all that he can from the body.}",
