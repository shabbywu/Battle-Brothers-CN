They're an awful mess, looking more like dishrags thrown to the mud than people. One, a man nursing a nub where his hand used to be, steps forward and speaks.%SPEECH_ON%I take it you're the one in charge?%SPEECH_OFF%Nodding, you ask the man what has happened and why it concerns the company. He explains, gesticulating with his one good hand.%SPEECH_ON%The greenskins are attacking.%SPEECH_OFF%Well, that's nothing new. You ask where they are and if they're goblins or orcs. The man shakes his head.%SPEECH_ON%Well, see, that's just the thing. It's both. They're... they're working together. Hordes of them as numerous as the blades of grass beneath our feet. I misspoke, in a way. What I should have said is that they aren't just attacking, they're INVADING. All of them. Together. An invasion beyond any scope or measure, don't you understand?%SPEECH_OFF%You look at the crowd of refugees. Children huddled beneath the skirts of their mothers, men looking lost. The man continues.%SPEECH_ON%My father fought in the Battle of Many Names. He always did say they'd come back and now I suppose he's right. We hear the noble houses are panicking and might join forces, lest we all be overrun! If you want my advice, I say stay out of it. Those hordes... there's no stopping them. And the things they do...%SPEECH_OFF%You grab the man by his shirt.%SPEECH_ON%The things they do don't worry me. Get out of here, peasant, and leave the fighting to the fighters.%SPEECH_OFF%",
    "translation": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_59.png[/img]%randombrother% 进入你的帐篷。%SPEECH_ON%先生，外面有一群难民想和你谈谈。%SPEECH_OFF%你把羽毛笔放在一边去见他们。 他们简直是一团糟，看起来更像是被扔到泥里的抹布，而不是人。 一个，一个男人抱着一个曾经是他手的地方，走上前说话。%SPEECH_ON%我猜你是这里的头儿？%SPEECH_OFF%你点了点头，随后问他发生了什么，为什么会来找你。 他一边解释，一边用他剩下的一只手做着手势。%SPEECH_ON%那些绿皮开始进攻了。%SPEECH_OFF%好吧，这不是什么新鲜事。 你问他们在哪里，他们是哥布林还是兽人。 他摇起头来。%SPEECH_ON%好吧，这就是问题所在。 两者都有。他们…他们聚在一起。 他们成群结队，就像我们脚下的草叶一样多。 从某种程度上看，我说错了。 我应该说的是，他们不仅仅是在攻击，他们是在侵略。 所有的绿皮。一起。 这是一种前所未有的灾难，你还不明白吗？%SPEECH_OFF%你看着这群难民。 孩子们蜷缩在母亲的裙子下，男人们看起来很迷茫。这个人接着说。%SPEECH_ON%我父亲是一名参加过许多大战役的老兵。 他总是说他们会回来，现在我想他是对的。 据说贵族家族惊慌失措，他们可能会为了某些利益联合起来，以免我们都被入侵！ 如果你需要我的建议，我建议你不要插手。 那些成群结队的…没有什么能阻止他们。 他们做的事…%SPEECH_OFF%你抓住他的衬衫。%SPEECH_ON%他们做的事我不担心。 离开这里，农民，把战斗留给战士们去打。%SPEECH_OFF%",
