You explain that the only reason the shield exists for the taking is because your men stepped forward to kill its owner. The leader of the group nods in agreement. He calls out that your company should take the heavier equipment as your men most certainly have better use for such things.\n\n As you divvy up the goods, one of the bowmen comes forward.%SPEECH_ON%I think one of them got away.

But flimsy bows like theirs come with hardened hands, well versed in getting arrows to targets they got no business finding. These are men of the forests. With confidence that this ambush will go right, you elect to join them.\n\n You don't have to wait long for the soldiers of %noblehouse% to start trundling there way over. They're loud, obnoxious, and some of them farting and complaining about mushrooms that they mistakenly ate.\n\n A kid about half your size releases the first shot. The arrow streaks between two branches and the lead scout drops to his knees. Leaves ruffle as though a great wind has come - arrows, sight unseen, zip into the soldiers' column and they're so true in aim that their targets die silently. A few of the soldiers manage to close the distance, raising swords and shields, but here the %companyname% steps in and cuts them down. After but a minute, the entire troop has been slain.",

It's pretty simple - you go around the ambush and come up from behind. The old men, desperate men, and naive boys are all slain in turn. They did not see it coming, but in the thick of the chaos some almost certainly escaped and have told of your betrayal.
