He shakes his head and spits.%SPEECH_ON%I'd heard word of you folks. Buncha trouserless men in a land of evil, like some devil's little joke sprung to life. The hell are you?%SPEECH_OFF%You shrug and tell the man that, so far, you've no issue with taking on your troubles sans leather or plate or cloth of loin. Again, the traveler shakes his head and spits.%SPEECH_ON%Farkin' hell. A man in battle with nothing on him is more naked than the day he'd done been born! I s'pose the irony is that if we - and I mean anybody-we - come find ya dead in the fields, then we'll probably dress ya better for the grave than you dress yourself now. Which shan't be hard, seeing as how you've dressed yourself none at all.%SPEECH_OFF%With a bit of a wave, you thank the traveler for his kind words before continuing your merry march.",
    "translation": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_16.png[/img]行军途中，你看到一个旅行者持续前后摇摆，而他的手却始终不知道是遮蔽阳光还是蒙住自己双眼。 他摇摇头，吐了一口唾沫。%SPEECH_ON%我听到你们的消息了。 在一个邪恶的国度里，没有穿裤子的人，就像一些恶魔戏剧般的冒了出来。 你在搞什么鬼？%SPEECH_OFF%你耸耸肩告诉那个人，到目前为止，你不需要皮革，盘子或腰布。 在一次地，旅行者摇摇头并吐了一口唾沫。%SPEECH_ON%扯蛋。一个身无分文的人在战斗中会比他出生的那天更一丝不挂！ 我觉得讽刺的是，如果我们－我是说任何人－我们－发现你死在田野里，我们会把你打扮的更体面然后下葬，绝对比你现在要体面。 这并不难，因为你以后不会再有衣服穿了。%SPEECH_OFF%你挥了挥手，感谢旅行者的忠言，然后继续愉快的行程。",
