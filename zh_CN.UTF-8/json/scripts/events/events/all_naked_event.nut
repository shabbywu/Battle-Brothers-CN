    "translation": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_16.png[/img]行军途中，你看到一个旅行者持续前后摇摆，而他的手却始终不知道是遮蔽阳光还是蒙住自己双眼。 他摇摇头，吐了一口唾沫。%SPEECH_ON%我听到你们的消息了。 在一个邪恶的国度里，没有穿裤子的人，就像一些恶魔戏剧般的冒了出来。 你在搞什么鬼？%SPEECH_OFF%你耸耸肩告诉那个人，到目前为止，你不需要皮革，盘子或腰布。 在一次地，旅行者摇摇头并吐了一口唾沫。%SPEECH_ON%扯蛋。一个身无分文的人在战斗中会比他出生的那天更一丝不挂！ 我觉得讽刺的是，如果我们－我是说任何人－我们－发现你死在田野里，我们会把你打扮的更体面然后下葬，绝对比你现在要体面。 这并不难，因为你以后不会再有衣服穿了。%SPEECH_OFF%你挥了挥手，感谢旅行者的忠言，然后继续愉快的行程。",
