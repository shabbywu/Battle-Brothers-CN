    "translation": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_16.png[/img]行军路上遇见个同路人，他身子前倾后仰折腾半天，手也不知道该遮太阳还是放任自己瞎眼。他摇摇头吐了口唾沫。%SPEECH_ON%早就听说你们这伙人了。在这鬼地方连条裤子都不穿，简直像魔鬼搞出来的烂笑话。你们到底在搞什么名堂？%SPEECH_OFF%你耸耸肩说，反正到现在光着膀子光着腚打打杀杀也没啥问题。赶路的又摇头吐唾沫。%SPEECH_ON%操蛋。打仗时候浑身光溜比刚生下来那会儿还光溜！要我说最讽刺的是，要是我们——随便哪个路人——发现你们死在野地里，给你们下葬时穿得肯定比现在体面。反正也不费事，毕竟你们现在压根啥也没穿。%SPEECH_OFF%你挥挥手，谢过他这番好话，继续快活地往前赶路。",
