    "original": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_58.png[/img]You are beginning to worry that a sort of malaise has fallen upon the men. They sit about the campfire, mindlessly poking sticks into the flames. Each face shows a loss of control, a loss of governance over one's own destiny. If a man can't know if tomorrow will be better than today, then how is he to keep pushing forward? Just as you are about to address this, %determined% stands up and so despondent is the mood that even the swift motion by itself catches the company's attention.%SPEECH_ON%Look at you bunch of sorry sad sacks. Do you think you're unique? Do you think you're the first to feel like shit? No, of course not. You'd not be the first to give up, either. To lay down and not rise again. That's the easy thing to do. That's what the world wants you to do. There's enough sonsabitches around, no need in having some sorry asses like yourselves mucking things up if you don't want no part and parcel in this punishment we call life.%SPEECH_OFF%Roused by this speech, you see a bit of a glint falling over the company.",
    "translation": "[img]gfx/ui/events/event_58.png[/img]你开始担心一种不祥之兆会降临在队员们身上。 他们围坐在篝火旁，没头没脑地往火里加木头。 每一张脸都表现出一种控制的缺失，确切说是掌握自己命运的那种缺失。 如果一个人不知道明天会不会比今天更好，那他怎么能继续前进呢？ 就在你要回答这个问题的时候，%determined% 站了起来，表情是如此的沮丧，但他快速转换情绪的能力让整个战团都感到震惊。%SPEECH_ON%看看你们这些可怜的家伙。 你认为你是独一无二的吗？ 你以为你是第一个觉得自己很糟糕的人吗？ 不，当然不。 你不应该是第一个放弃的人。 躺下，就不再起来。 这是一件容易的事。 这就是这个世界想搞你的。 周围操蛋的事多了去了，如果你不想在这种我们称之为生活的惩罚中消沉，就没有必要像你们这样把事情想得一团糟。%SPEECH_OFF%这番话一出，你就看到整个战团一片欢腾。",
